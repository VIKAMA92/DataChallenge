It does not in the least concern you to know\\n', 'what manner of woman she was. Be content with the knowledge that, ere the\\n', 'voyage had ended, both she and I were desperately and unreasoningly in love\\n', 'with one another. Heaven knows that I can make the admission now without one\\n', 'particle of vanity. In matters of this sort there is always one who gives and\\n', 'another who accepts. From the first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was\\n', \"conscious that Agnes's passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and--if I may\\n\", 'use the expression--a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she recognized the\\n', 'fact then, I do not know. Afterward it was bitterly plain to both of us.\\n', '\\n', 'Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective ways, to\\n', 'meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave and her love\\n', 'took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together; and there my fire\\n', 'of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing year. I attempt\\n', 'no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington had given up much for my sake,\\n', 'and was prepared to give up all. From my own lips, in August, 1882, she\\n', 'learned that I was sick of her presence, tired of her company, and weary of\\n', 'the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine women out of a hundred would have wearied\\n', 'of me as I wearied of them; seventy-five of that number would have promptly\\n', 'avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation with other men. Mrs.\\n', 'Wessington was the hundredth. On her neither my openly expressed aversion nor\\n', 'the cutting brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least\\n', 'effect. \"Jack, darling!\" was her one eternal cuckoo cry: \"I\\'m sure it\\'s all a\\n', \"mistake--a hideous mistake; and we'll be good friends again some day. Please\\n\", 'forgive me, Jack, dear.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity into\\n', 'passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate--the same instinct, I\\n', 'suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider he has but half\\n', 'killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882 came to an end.\\n', '\\n', 'Next year we met again at Simla--she with her monotonous face and timid\\n', 'attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every fibre of my\\n', 'frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each occasion\\n', 'her words were identically the same. Still the unreasoning wail that it was\\n', 'all a \"mistake\"; and still the hope of eventually \"making friends.\" I might\\n', 'have seen had I cared to look, that that hope only was keeping her alive. She\\n', 'grew more wan and thin month by month. You will agree with me, at least, that\\n', 'such conduct would have driven any one to despair. It was uncalled for;\\n', 'childish; unwomanly. I maintain that she was much to blame. And again,\\n', 'sometimes, in the black, fever-stricken night-watches, I have begun to think\\n', 'that I might have been a little kinder to her.

When I\\n', 'think it over quietly in my sick-room, the season of 1884 seems a confused\\n', 'nightmare wherein light and shade were fantastically intermingled--my\\n', 'courtship of little Kitty Mannering; my hopes, doubts, and fears; our long\\n', 'rides together; my trembling avowal of attachment; her reply; and now and\\n', \"again a vision of a white face flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the black and\\n\", \"white liveries I once watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessington's\\n\", 'gloved hand; and, when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome\\n', 'monotony of her appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering; honestly, heartily loved her,\\n', 'and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August Kitty and I were\\n', 'engaged. The next day I met those accursed \"magpie\" jhampanies at the back of\\n', 'Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of pity, stopped to tell Mrs.\\n', 'Wessington everything. She knew it already.\\n', '\\n', '\"So I hear you\\'re engaged, Jack dear.\" Then, without a moment\\'s pause--\"I\\'m\\n', \"sure it's all a mistake--a hideous mistake. We shall be as good friends some\\n\", 'day, Jack, as we ever were.\"\\n', '\\n', 'My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman before me\\n', 'like the blow of a whip. \"Please forgive me, Jack; I didn\\'t mean to make you\\n', 'angry; but it\\'s true, it\\'s true!\"\\n', '\\n', 'And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to\\n', 'finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that I had\\n', 'been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she had turned her\\n', \"'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me.\\n\", '\\n', 'The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory.\\n', '\\n', 'The rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden, dingy\\n', 'pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed a gloomy\\n', 'background against which the black and white liveries of the jhampanies, the\\n', \"yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's down-bowed golden head stood\\n\", 'out clearly. She was holding her handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning\\n', \"hack exhausted against the 'rickshaw cushions. I turned my horse up a bypath\\n\", 'near the Sanjowlie Reservoir and literally ran away. Once I fancied I heard a\\n', 'faint call of \"Jack!\" This may have been imagination. I never stopped to\\n', 'verify it. Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in the\\n', 'delight of a long ride with her, forgot all about the interview.\\n', '\\n', 'A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her\\n', 'existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy. Before\\n', 'three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except that at times the\\n', 'discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly of our bygone\\n', 'relationship. By January I had disinterred what was left of our correspondence\\n', 'from among my scattered belongings and had burned it. At the beginning of\\n', 'April of this year, 1885, I was at Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and\\n', \"was deep in lover's talks and walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should\\n\", 'be married at the end of June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving\\n', 'Kitty as I did, I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been,\\n', 'at that time, the happiest man in India.\\n', '\\n', 'Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight.\\n', '\\n', 'Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals circumstanced as\\n', 'we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement ring was the outward and\\n', 'visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and that she must forthwith\\n', \"come to Hamilton's to be measured for one. Up to that moment, I give you my\\n\", \"word, we had completely forgotten so trivial a matter. To Hamilton's we\\n\", 'accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885. Remember that--whatever my doctor\\n', 'may say to the contrary--I was then in perfect health, enjoying a well-\\n', \"balanced mind and an absolute tranquil spirit. Kitty and I entered Hamilton's\\n\", 'shop together, and there, regardless of the order of affairs, I measured Kitty\\n', 'for the ring in the presence of the amused assistant. The ring was a sapphire\\n', 'with two diamonds. We then rode out down the slope that leads to the\\n', \"Combermere Bridge and Peliti's shop.\\n\", '\\n', ' While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and Kitty\\n', 'was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is to say as\\n', 'much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round the Reading-\\n', \"room and Peliti's veranda,--I was aware that some one, apparently at a vast\\n\", 'distance, was calling me by my Christian name. It struck me that I had heard\\n', 'the voice before, but when and where I could not at once determine. In the\\n', \"short space it took to cover the road between the path from Hamilton's shop\\n\", 'and the first plank of the Combermere Bridge I had thought over half a dozen\\n', 'people who might have committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided\\n', \"that it must have been singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Peliti's shop\\n\", 'my eye was arrested by the sight of four jharnpanies in \"magpie\" livery,\\n', \"pulling a yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw. In a moment my mind flew\\n\", 'back to the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense of irritation and\\n', 'disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with, without her\\n', \"black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the day's happiness? Whoever\\n\", 'employed them now I thought I would call upon, and ask as a personal favor to\\n', \"change her jhampanies' livery. I would hire the men myself, and, if necessary,\\n\", 'buy their coats from off their backs. It is impossible to say here what a\\n', 'flood of undesirable memories their presence evoked.\\n', '\\n', '\"Kitty,\" I cried, \"there are poor Mrs. Wessington\\'s jhampanies turned up\\n', 'again! I wonder who has them now?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always been\\n', 'interested in the sickly woman.\\n', ' \"What? Where?\" she asked. \"I can\\'t see them anywhere.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Even as she spoke her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself\\n', \"directly in front of the advancing 'rickshaw. I had scarcely time to utter a\\n\", 'word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider passed through\\n', 'men and carriage as if they had been thin air.                   \\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the matter?\" cried Kitty; \"what made you call out so foolishly, Jack?\\n', \"If I am engaged I don't want all creation to know about it. There was lots of\\n\", \"space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you think I can't ride--\\n\", '\\n', '\"--There!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Whereupon wilful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a hand-\\n', 'gallop in the direction of the Bandstand; fully expecting, as she herself\\n', 'afterward told me, that I should follow her. What was the matter? Nothing\\n', 'indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla was haunted with devils.\\n', \"I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round. The 'rickshaw had turned too,\\n\", 'and now stood immediately facing me, near the left railing of the Combermere\\n', 'Bridge.\\n', '\\n', '\"Jack! Jack, darling!\" (There was no mistake about the words this time: they\\n', 'rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) \"It\\'s some\\n', \"hideous mistake, I'm sure. Please forgive me, jack, and let's be friends\\n\", 'again.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and pray daily for\\n\", 'the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief in hand,\\n', 'and golden head bowed on her breast.\\n', '\\n', 'How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by my syce\\n', \"taking the Waler's bridle and asking whether I was ill. From the horrible to\\n\", 'the commonplace is but a step. I tumbled off my horse and dashed, half\\n', \"fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of cherry-brandy. There two or three\\n\", 'couples were gathered round the coffee-tables discussing the gossip of the\\n', 'day. Their trivialities were more comforting to me just then than the\\n', 'consolations of religion could have been. I plunged into the midst of the\\n', 'conversation at once; chatted, laughed, and jested with a face (when I caught\\n', 'a glimpse of it in a mirror) as white and drawn as that of a corpse. Three or\\n', 'four mem noticed my condition; and, evidently setting it down to the results\\n', 'of over-many pegs, charitably endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of\\n', 'the loungers. But I refused to be led away. I wanted the company of my kind--\\n', 'as a child rushes into the midst of the dinner-party after a fright in the\\n', 'dark. I must have talked for about ten minutes or so, though it seemed an\\n', \"eternity to me, when I heard Kitty's clear voice outside inquiring for me. In\\n\", 'another minute she had entered the shop, prepared to roundly upbraid me for\\n', 'failing so signally in my duties. Something in my face stopped her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Why, Jack,\" she cried, \"what have you been doing? What has happened? Are you\\n', 'ill?\" Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the sun had been a little too\\n', \"much for me. It was close upon five o'clock of a cloudy April afternoon, and\\n\", 'the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my mistake as soon as the words were\\n', 'out of my mouth: attempted to recover it; blundered hopelessly and followed\\n', 'Kitty in a regal rage, out of doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances. I\\n', 'made some excuse (I have forgotten what) on the score of my feeling faint; and\\n', 'cantered away to my hotel, leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself.\\n', '\\n', 'In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter.\\n', '\\n', 'Here was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in the year\\n', 'of grace, 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in terror from my\\n', \"sweetheart's side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and buried\\n\", 'eight months ago. These were facts that I could not blink. Nothing was further\\n', 'from my thought than any memory of Mrs. Wessington when Kitty and I left\\n', \"Hamilton's shop. Nothing was more utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall\\n\", \"opposite Peliti's. It was broad daylight. The road was full of people; and yet\\n\", 'here, look you, in defiance of every law of probability, in direct outrage of\\n', \"Nature's ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave.\\n\", '\\n', \"Kitty's Arab had gone through the 'rickshaw: so that my first hope that some\\n\", 'woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage and the coolies\\n', 'with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went round this treadmill of\\n', 'thought; and again and again gave up baffled and in despair. The voice was as\\n', 'inexplicable as the apparition. I had originally some wild notion of confiding\\n', 'it all to Kitty; of begging her to marry me at once; and in her arms defying\\n', 'the ghostly occupant of the \\'rickshaw. \"After all,\" I argued, \"the presence of\\n', \"the 'rickshaw is in itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral\\n\", 'illusion. One may see ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and\\n', 'carriages. The whole thing is absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hill-man!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook my\\n', 'strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very wroth,\\n', 'and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency born of\\n', 'night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked with sudden\\n', 'palpitation of the heart--the result of indigestion. This eminently practical\\n', 'solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out that afternoon with the\\n', 'shadow of my first lie dividing us.\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still\\n', 'unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,\\n', 'suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything rather\\n', 'than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt: so I yielded from\\n', 'fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out together toward\\n', 'Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and, according to our\\n', 'custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent to the stretch of level\\n', 'road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched horses appeared to fly, and my\\n', 'heart beat quicker and quicker as we neared the crest of the ascent. My mind\\n', 'had been full of Mrs. Wessington all the afternoon; and every inch of the\\n', 'Jakko road bore witness to our oldtime walks and talks. The bowlders were full\\n', 'of it; the pines sang it aloud overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and\\n', 'chuckled unseen over the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the\\n', 'iniquity aloud.\\n', '\\n', \"As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladies' Mile the\\n\", \"Horror was awaiting me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight--only the four black\\n\", 'and white jhampanies, the yellow-paneled carriage, and the golden head of the\\n', 'woman within--all apparently just as I had left them eight months and one\\n', 'fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that Kitty must see what I saw--we\\n', 'were so marvelously sympathetic in all things. Her next words undeceived me--\\n', '\"Not a soul in sight! Come along, Jack, and I\\'ll race you to the Reservoir\\n', 'buildings!\" Her wiry little Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close\\n', 'behind, and in this order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us\\n', \"within fifty yards of the 'rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little.\\n\", \"The 'rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road; and once more the Arab\\n\", 'passed through it, my horse following. \"Jack! Jack dear! Please forgive me,\"\\n', 'rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval:--\"It\\'s a mistake, a\\n', 'hideous mistake!\"\\n', '\\n', 'I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at the\\n', 'Reservoir works, the black and white liveries were still waiting--patiently\\n', 'waiting--under the grey hillside, and the wind brought me a mocking echo of\\n', 'the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered me a good deal on my silence\\n', 'throughout the remainder of the ride. I had been talking up till then wildly\\n', 'and at random.\\n', '\\n', 'To save my life I could not speak afterward naturally, and from Sanjowlie to\\n', 'the Church wisely held my tongue.\\n', '\\n', 'I was to dine with the Mannerings that night, and had barely time to canter\\n', 'home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men talking\\n', 'together in the dusk.--\"It\\'s a curious thing,\" said one, \"how completely all\\n', 'trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely fond of the woman\\n', \"('never could see anything in her myself), and wanted me to pick up her old\\n\", \"'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for love or money. Morbid sort of\\n\", \"fancy I call it; but I've got to do what the Memsahib tells me.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four of\\n', 'the men--they were brothers--died of cholera on the way to Hardwar, poor\\n', \"devils, and the 'rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself. 'Told me he\\n\", \"never used a dead Memsahib's 'rickshaw. 'Spoiled his luck.' Queer notion,\\n\", \"wasn't it? Fancy poor little Mrs. Wessington spoiling any one's luck except\\n\", 'her own!\" I laughed aloud at this point; and my laugh jarred on me as I\\n', \"uttered it. So there were ghosts of 'rickshaws after all, and ghostly\\n\", 'employments in the other world! How much did Mrs. Wessington give her men?\\n', 'What were their hours? Where did they go?\\n', '\\n', 'And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal Thing blocking\\n', 'my path in the twilight. The dead travel fast, and by short cuts unknown to\\n', 'ordinary coolies. I laughed aloud a second time and checked my laughter\\n', 'suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad. Mad to a certain extent I must\\n', 'have been, for I recollect that I reined in my horse at the head of the\\n', '\\'rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington \"Good evening.\" Her answer was\\n', 'one I knew only too well. I listened to the end; and replied that I had heard\\n', 'it all before, but should be delighted if she had anything further to say.\\n', 'Some malignant devil stronger than I must have entered into me that evening,\\n', 'for I have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five\\n', 'minutes to the Thing in front of me.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mad as a hatter, poor devil--or drunk. Max, try and get him to come home.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Surely that was not Mrs. Wessington's voice! The two men had overheard me\\n\", 'speaking to the empty air, and had returned to look after me. They were very\\n', 'kind and considerate, and from their words evidently gathered that I was\\n', 'extremely drunk. I thanked them confusedly and cantered away to my hotel,\\n', \"there changed, and arrived at the Mannerings' ten minutes late. I pleaded the\\n\", 'darkness of the night as an excuse; was rebuked by Kitty for my unlover-like\\n', 'tardiness; and sat down.\\n', '\\n', 'The conversation had already become general; and under cover of it, I was\\n', 'addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware that at\\n', 'the further end of the table a short red-whiskered man was describing, with\\n', 'much broidery, his encounter with a mad unknown that evening.\\n', '\\n', 'A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half an\\n', 'hour ago. In the middle of the story he looked round for applause, as\\n', 'professional story-tellers do, caught my eye, and straightway collapsed. There\\n', \"was a moment's awkward silence, and the red-whiskered man muttered something\\n\", 'to the effect that he had \"forgotten the rest,\" thereby sacrificing a\\n', 'reputation as a good story~teller which he had built up for six seasons past.\\n', 'I blessed him from the bottom of my heart, and--went on with my fish.\\n', '\\n', 'In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end; and with genuine regret I\\n', 'tore myself away from Kitty--as certain as I was of my own existence that It\\n', 'would be waiting for me outside the door. The red-whiskered man, who had been\\n', 'introduced to me as Doctor Heatherlegh, of Simla, volunteered to bear me\\n', 'company as far as our roads lay together. I accepted his offer with gratitude.\\n', '\\n', 'My instinct had not deceived me. It lay in readiness in the Mall, and, in what\\n', 'seemed devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp. The red-\\n', 'whiskered man went to the point at once, in a manner that showed he bad been\\n', 'thinking over it all dinner time.\\n', '\\n', '\"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on the\\n', 'Elysium road?\" The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer from me\\n', 'before I was aware.\\n', '\\n', '\"That!\" said I, pointing to It.\\n', '\\n', '\"That may be either D. T. or Eyes for aught I know. Now you don\\'t liquor. I\\n', \"saw as much at dinner, so it can't be D. T. There's nothing whatever where\\n\", \"you're pointing, though you're sweating and trembling with fright like a\\n\", \"scared pony. Therefore, I conclude that it's Eyes. And I ought to understand\\n\", 'all about them. Come along home with me. I\\'m on the Blessington lower road.\"\\n', '\\n', \"To my intense delight the 'rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about\\n\", 'twenty yards ahead--and this, too whether we walked, trotted, or cantered. In\\n', 'the course of that long night ride I had told my companion almost as much as I\\n', 'have told you here.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, you\\'ve spoiled one of the best tales I\\'ve ever laid tongue to,\" said\\n', 'he, \"but I\\'ll forgive you for the sake of what you\\'ve gone through.

We left the Mannerings' house together, laughing and\\n\", 'talking, and cantered along the Chota Simla road as of old.\\n', '\\n', 'I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my assurance\\n', 'doubly sure. The horses did their best, but seemed all too slow to my\\n', 'impatient mind. Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness. \"Why, Jack!\" she\\n', 'cried at last, \"you are behaving like a child.

My answer was the cut of her\\n', 'riding-whip across my face from mouth to eye, and a word or two of farewell\\n', 'that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and judged rightly, that Kitty\\n', \"knew all; and I staggered back to the side of the 'rickshaw.

You corresponded a good deal,\\n', \"you young people.

Heatherlegh told me in the morning that he\\n', 'had received an answer from Mr. Mannering, and that, thanks to his\\n', \"(Heatherlegh's) friendly offices, the story of my affliction had traveled\\n\", 'through the length and breadth of Simla, where I was on all sides much pitied.\\n', '\\n', '\"And that\\'s rather more than you deserve,\" he concluded, pleasantly, \"though\\n', \"the Lord knows you've been going through a pretty severe mill.

There were scores of men no better than I\\n', 'whose punishments had at least been reserved for another world; and I felt\\n', 'that it was bitterly, cruelly unfair that I alone should have been singled out\\n', 'for so hideous a fate.

From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward\\n', 'for seven weary days; my body growing daily stronger and stronger, until the\\n', 'bedroom looking-glass told me that I had returned to everyday life, and was as\\n', 'other men once more. Curiously enough my face showed no signs of the struggle\\n', 'I had gone through. It was pale indeed, but as expressionless and commonplace\\n', 'as ever.

I found nothing.\\n', '\\n', \"On the 15th of May, I left Heatherlegh's house at eleven o'clock in the\\n\", 'morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club. There I found\\n', 'that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in clumsy\\n', 'fashion, abnormally kind and attentive. Nevertheless I recognized that for the\\n', 'rest of my natural life I should be among but not of my fellows; and I envied\\n', 'very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the Mall below. I lunched at the\\n', \"Club, and at four o'clock wandered aimlessly down the Mall in the vague hope\\n\", 'of meeting Kitty. Close to the Band-stand the black and white liveries joined\\n', \"me; and I heard Mrs. Wessington's old appeal at my side. I had been expecting\\n\", 'this ever since I came out; and was only surprised at her delay. The phantom\\n', \"'rickshaw and I went side by side along the Chota Simla road in silence. Close\\n\", 'to the bazar, Kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us. For any\\n', 'sign she gave I might have been a dog in the road.

Two\\n', 'or three times I found myself saying to myself almost aloud:\"I\\'m Jack Pansay\\n', \"on leave at Simla--at Simla! Everyday, ordinary Simla. I mustn't forget that--\\n\", 'I mustn\\'t forget that.\" Then I would try to recollect some of the gossip I had\\n', \"heard at the Club: the prices of So-and-So's horses--anything, in fact, that\\n\", 'related to the workaday Anglo-Indian world I knew so well. I even repeated the\\n', 'multiplication-table rapidly to myself, to make quite sure that I was not\\n', 'taking leave of my senses. It gave me much comfort; and must have prevented my\\n', 'hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.\\n', '\\n', 'Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level road. Here\\n', 'Kitty and the man started off at a canter, and I was left alone with Mrs.\\n', 'Wessington. \"Agnes,\" said I, \"will you put back your hood and tell me what it\\n', 'all means?\" The hood dropped noiselessly, and I was face to face with my dead\\n', 'and buried mistress. She was wearing the dress in which I had last seen her\\n', 'alive; carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand; and the same\\n', 'cardcase in her left. (A woman eight months dead with a cardcase!) I had to\\n', 'pin myself down to the multiplication-table, and to set both hands on the\\n', 'stone parapet of the road, to assure myself that that at least was real.\\n', '\\n', '\"Agnes,\" I repeated, \"for pity\\'s sake tell me what it all means.\" Mrs.\\n', 'Wessington leaned forward, with that odd, quick turn of the head I used to\\n', 'know so well, and spoke.\\n', '\\n', 'If my story had not already so madly overleaped the hounds of all human belief\\n', 'I should apologize to you now.

There was no insult in his\\n', 'choice of the term. He had forgotten the other word, I suppose.\\n', '\\n', 'While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself down,\\n', 'after exploring the dak-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside my own, which\\n', 'was a corner kennel, each giving into the other through dingy white doors\\n', 'fastened with long iron bars.

Then came the ratub--a curious meal, half\\n', 'native and half English in composition--with the old khansamah babbling behind\\n', 'my chair about dead and gone English people, and the wind-blown candles\\n', 'playing shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the mosquito-curtains. It was just the\\n', 'sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every single one of his past\\n', 'sins, and of all the others that he intended to commit if he lived.\\n', '\\n', 'Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy.

No other sound\\n', 'is like it. A minute afterwards there was another whir, and I got into bed. I\\n', 'was not frightened--indeed I was not. I was very curious to know what had\\n', 'become of the doolies. I jumped into bed for that reason.\\n', '\\n', 'Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up.

I argued the matter out at great length with myself;\\n', 'and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one bed, one table, and\\n', 'two chairs--all the furniture of the room next to mine--could so exactly\\n', 'duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards. After another cannon, a three--\\n', 'cushion one to judge by the whir, I argued no more. I had found my ghost and\\n', 'would have given worlds to have escaped from that dak-bungalow. I listened,\\n', 'and with each listen the game grew clearer.\\n', '\\n', 'There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes there was a double click\\n', 'and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort of doubt, people were playing\\n', 'billiards in the next room. And the next room was not big enough to hold a\\n', 'billiard table!\\n', '\\n', 'Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forward--stroke after\\n', 'stroke.

My coolies were neither more nor less\\n', 'exasperating than other gangs, and my work demanded sufficient attention to\\n', 'keep me from moping, had I been inclined to so unmanly a weakness.\\n', '\\n', 'On the 23d December, 1884, I felt a little feverish. There was a full moon at\\n', 'the time, and, in consequence, every dog near my tent was baying it. The\\n', 'brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic. A few days\\n', 'previously I had shot one loud-mouthed singer and suspended his carcass in\\n', 'terrorem about fifty yards from my tent-door.

This, of course, was merely the semi-delirious\\n', 'notion of a fever patient; but I remember that it struck me at the time as\\n', 'being eminently practical and feasible.\\n', '\\n', 'I therefore ordered my groom to saddle Pornic and bring him round quietly to\\n', 'the rear of my tent. When the pony was ready, I stood at his head prepared to\\n', 'mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift up his voice. Pornic,\\n', 'by the way, had not been out of his pickets for a couple of days; the night\\n', 'air was crisp and chilly; and I was armed with a specially long and sharp pair\\n', 'of persuaders with which I had been rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon. You\\n', 'will easily believe, then, that when he was let go he went quickly. In one\\n', 'moment, for the brute bolted as straight as a die, the tent was left far\\n', 'behind, and we were flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed.\\n', '\\n', 'In another we had passed the wretched dog, and I had almost forgotten why it\\n', 'was that I had taken the horse and hogspear.\\n', '\\n', 'The delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the air must\\n', 'have taken away the remnant of my senses. I have a faint recollection of\\n', 'standing upright in my stirrups, and of brandishing my hog-spear at the great\\n', 'white Moon that looked down so calmly on my mad gallop; and of shouting\\n', 'challenges to the camel-thorn bushes as they whizzed past. Once or twice I\\n', \"believe, I swayed forward on Pornic's neck, and literally hung on by my spurs-\\n\", '-as the marks next morning showed.\\n', '\\n', 'The wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed, over what seemed to be\\n', 'a limitless expanse of moonlit sand. Next, I remember, the ground rose\\n', 'suddenly in front of us, and as we topped the ascent I saw the waters of the\\n', 'Sutlej shining like a silver bar below. Then Pornic blundered heavily on his\\n', 'nose, and we rolled together down some unseen slope.\\n', '\\n', 'I must have lost consciousness, for when I recovered I was lying on my stomach\\n', 'in a heap of soft white sand, and the dawn was beginning to break dimly over\\n', 'the edge of the slope down which I had fallen. As the light grew stronger I\\n', 'saw that I was at the bottom of a horse-shoe shaped crater of sand, opening on\\n', 'one side directly on to the shoals of the Sutlej.

His saddle, a favorite polo\\n', 'one, was much knocked about, and had been twisted under his belly. It took me\\n', 'some time to put him to rights, and in the meantime I had ample opportunities\\n', 'of observing the spot into which I had so foolishly dropped.\\n', '\\n', 'At the risk of being considered tedious, I must describe it at length:\\n', 'inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of\\n', 'material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows.\\n', '\\n', 'Imagine then, as I have said before, a horseshoe-shaped crater of sand with\\n', 'steeply graded sand walls about thirty-five feet high. (The slope, I fancy,\\n', 'must have been about 65 degrees.) This crater enclosed a level piece of ground\\n', 'about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part, with a crude well in\\n', 'the centre. Round the bottom of the crater, about three feet from the level of\\n', 'the ground proper, ran a series of eighty-three semi-circular ovoid, square,\\n', 'and multilateral holes, all about three feet at the mouth. Each hole on\\n', 'inspection showed that it was carefully shored internally with drift-wood and\\n', 'bamboos, and over the mouth a wooden drip-board projected, like the peak of a\\n', \"jockey's cap, for two feet. No sign of life was visible in these tunnels, but\\n\", 'a most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatre--a stench fouler than\\n', 'any which my wanderings in Indian villages have introduced me to.\\n', '\\n', 'Having remounted Pornic, who was as anxious as I to get back to camp, I rode\\n', 'round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit would be\\n', 'practicable. The inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not thought fit to\\n', 'put in an appearance, so I was left to my own devices. My first attempt to\\n', '\"rush\" Pornic up the steep sand-banks showed me that I had fallen into a trap\\n', 'exactly on the same model as that which the ant-lion sets for its prey. At\\n', 'each step the shifting sand poured down from above in tons, and rattled on the\\n', 'drip-boards of the holes like small shot. A couple of ineffectual charges sent\\n', 'us both rolling down to the bottom, half choked with the torrents of sand; and\\n', 'I was constrained to turn my attention to the river-bank.\\n', '\\n', 'Here everything seemed easy enough. The sand hills ran down to the river edge,\\n', 'it is true, but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across which I could\\n', 'gallop Pornic, and find my way back to terra firma by turning sharply to the\\n', 'right or left. As I led Pornic over the sands I was startled by the faint pop\\n', 'of a rifle across the river; and at the same moment a bullet dropped with a\\n', 'sharp \"whit\" close to Pornic\\'s head.\\n', '\\n', 'There was no mistaking the nature of the missile-a regulation Martini-Henry\\n', '\"picket.\" About five hundred yards away a country-boat was anchored in\\n', 'midstream; and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in the still morning\\n', 'air showed me whence the delicate attention had come. Was ever a respectable\\n', 'gentleman in such an impasse? The treacherous sand slope allowed no escape\\n', 'from a spot which I had visited most involuntarily, and a promenade on the\\n', 'river frontage was the signal for a bombardment from some insane native in a\\n', \"boat. I'm afraid that I lost my temper very much indeed.\\n\", '\\n', 'Another bullet reminded me that I had better save my breath to cool my\\n', 'porridge; and I retreated hastily up the sands and back to the horseshoe,\\n', 'where I saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixty-five human beings from\\n', 'the badger-holes which I had up till that point supposed to be untenanted. I\\n', 'found myself in the midst of a crowd of spectators--about forty men, twenty\\n', 'women, and one child who could not have been more than five years old. They\\n', 'were all scantily clothed in that salmon-colored cloth which one associates\\n', 'with Hindu mendicants, and, at first sight, gave me the impression of a band\\n', 'of loathsome fakirs. The filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond\\n', 'all description, and I shuddered to think what their life in the badger-holes\\n', 'must be.\\n', '\\n', 'Even in these days, when local self government has destroyed the greater part\\n', \"of a native's respect for a Sahib, I have been accustomed to a certain amount\\n\", 'of civility from my inferiors, and on approaching the crowd naturally expected\\n', 'that there would be some recognition of my presence. As a matter of fact there\\n', 'was; but it was by no means what I had looked for.\\n', '\\n', 'The ragged crew actually laughed at me--such laughter I hope I may never hear\\n', 'again.  They cackled, yelled, whistled, and howled as I walked into their\\n', 'midst; some of them literally throwing themselves down on the ground in\\n', \"convulsions of unholy mirth. In a moment I had let go Pornic's head, and.\\n\", \"irritated beyond expression at the morning's adventure, commenced cuffing\\n\", 'those nearest to me with all the force I could. The wretches dropped under my\\n', 'blows like nine-pins, and the laughter gave place to wails for mercy; while\\n', 'those yet untouched clasped me round the knees, imploring me in all sorts of\\n', 'uncouth tongues to spare them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the tumult, and just when I was feeling very much ashamed of myself for\\n', 'having thus easily given way to my temper, a thin, high voice murmured in\\n', 'English from behind my shoulder: \"--Sahib! Sahib! Do you not know me? Sahib,\\n', 'it is Gunga Dass, the telegraph-master.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I spun round quickly and faced the speaker.\\n', '\\n', \"Gunga Dass, (I have, of course, no hesitation in mentioning the man's real\\n\", 'name) I had known four years before as a Deccanee Brahmin loaned by the Punjab\\n', 'Government to one of the Khalsia States. He was in charge of a branch\\n', 'telegraph-office there, and when I had last met him was a jovial, full-\\n', 'stomached, portly Government servant with a marvelous capacity for making had\\n', 'puns in English--a peculiarity which made me remember him long after I had\\n', 'forgotten his services to me in his official capacity. It is seldom that a\\n', 'Hindu makes English puns.\\n', '\\n', 'Now, however, the man was changed beyond all recognition. Caste-mark, stomach,\\n', 'slate-colored continuations, and unctuous speech were all gone. I looked at a\\n', 'withered skeleton, turban-less and almost naked, with long matted hair and\\n', 'deep-set codfish-eyes.\\n', '\\n', 'But for a crescent-shaped scar on the left cheek--the result of an accident\\n', 'for which I was responsible I should never have known him. But it was\\n', 'indubitably Gunga Dass, and--for this I was thankful--an English-speaking\\n', 'native who might at least tell me the meaning of all that I had gone through\\n', 'that day.\\n', '\\n', 'The crowd retreated to some distance as I turned toward the miserable figure,\\n', 'and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the crate. He held a\\n', 'freshly plucked crow in his hand, and in reply to my question climbed slowly\\n', 'on a platform of sand which ran in front of the holes, and commenced lighting\\n', 'a fire there in silence. Dried bents, sand-poppies, and driftwood burn\\n', 'quickly; and I derived much consolation from the fact that he lit them with an\\n', 'ordinary sulphur-match. When they were in a bright glow, and the crow was\\n', 'neatly spitted in front thereof, Gunga Dass began without a word of preamble:\\n', '\\n', '\"There are only two kinds of men, Sar. The alive and the dead. When you are\\n', 'dead you are dead, but when you are alive you live.\" (Here the crow demanded\\n', 'his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in danger of being\\n', 'burned to a cinder.) \"If you die at home and do not die when you come to the\\n', 'ghat to be burned you come here.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The nature of the reeking village was made plain now, and all that I had known\\n', 'or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact just\\n', 'communicated by the ex-Brahmin. Sixteen years ago, when I first landed in\\n', 'Bombay, I had been told by a wandering Armenian of the existence, somewhere in\\n', 'India, of a place to which such Hindus as had the misfortune to recover from\\n', 'trance or catalepsy were conveyed and kept, and I recollect laughing heartily\\n', \"at what I was then pleased to consider a traveler's tale.\\n\", '\\n', \"Sitting at the bottom of the sand-trap, the memory of Watson's Hotel, with its\\n\", 'swinging punkahs, white-robed attendants, and the sallow-faced Armenian, rose\\n', 'up in my mind as vividly as a photograph, and I burst into a loud fit of\\n', 'laughter. The contrast was too absurd!\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass, as he bent over the unclean bird, watched me curiously. Hindus\\n', 'seldom laugh, and his surroundings were not such as to move Gunga Dass to any\\n', 'undue excess of hilarity. He removed the crow solemnly from the wooden spit\\n', 'and as solemnly devoured it. Then he continued his story, which I give in his\\n', 'own words:\\n', '\\n', '\"In epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before you\\n', 'are dead. When you come to the riverside the cold air, perhaps, makes you\\n', 'alive, and then, if you are only little alive, mud is put on your nose and\\n', 'mouth and you die conclusively. If you are rather more alive, more mud is put;\\n', 'but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away. I was too lively,\\n', 'and made protestation with anger against the indignities that they endeavored\\n', 'to press upon me. In those days I was Brahmin and proud man.\\n', '\\n', 'Now I am dead man and eat\"--here he eyed the well-gnawed breast bone with the\\n', 'first sign of emotion that I had seen in him since we met--\"crows, and other\\n', 'things. They took me from my sheets when they saw that I was too lively and\\n', 'gave me medicines for one week, and I survived successfully. Then they sent me\\n', 'by rail from my place to Okara Station, with a man to take care of me; and at\\n', 'Okara Station we met two other men, and they conducted we three on camels, in\\n', 'the night, from Okara Station to this place, and they propelled me from the\\n', 'top to the bottom, and the other two succeeded, and I have been here ever\\n', 'since two and a half years. Once I was Brahmin and proud man, and now I eat\\n', 'crows.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There is no way of getting out?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"None of what kind at all. When I first came I made experiments frequently and\\n', 'all the others also, but we have always succumbed to the sand which is\\n', 'precipitated upon our heads.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But surely,\" I broke in at this point, \"the river-front is open, and it is\\n', 'worth while dodging the bullets; while at night\"--I had already matured a\\n', 'rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness forbade me\\n', 'sharing with Gunga Dass. He, however, divined my unspoken thought almost as\\n', 'soon as it was formed; and, to my intense astonishment, gave vent to a long\\n', 'low chuckle of derision--the laughter, be it understood, of a superior or at\\n', 'least of an equal.\\n', '\\n', '\"You will not\"--he had dropped the Sir completely after his opening sentence--\\n', '\"make any escape that way. But you can try. I have tried. Once only.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which I had in vain attempted\\n', 'to strive against overmastered me completely. My long fast--it was now close\\n', \"upon ten o'clock, and I had eaten nothing since tiffin on the previous day--\\n\", 'combined with the violent and unnatural agitation of the ride had exhausted\\n', 'me, and I verily believe that, for a few minutes, I acted as one mad. I hurled\\n', 'myself against the pitiless sand-slope. I ran round the base of the crater,\\n', 'blaspheming and praying by turns. I crawled out among the sedges of the river-\\n', 'front, only to be driven back each time in an agony of nervous dread by the\\n', 'rifle-bullets which cut up the sand round me--for I dared not face the death\\n', 'of a mad dog among that hideous crowd--and finally fell, spent and raving, at\\n', 'the curb of the well. No one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition\\n', 'which makes me blush hotly even when I think of it now.\\n', '\\n', 'Two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water, but they were\\n', 'evidently used to this sort of thing, and had no time to waste upon me. The\\n', 'situation was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had banked the embers\\n', 'of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water\\n', 'over my head, an attention for which I could have fallen on my knees and\\n', 'thanked him, but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless, wheezy\\n', 'key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the shoals. And so, in a\\n', 'semi-comatose condition, I lay till noon.\\n', '\\n', 'Then, being only a man after all, I felt hungry, and intimated as much to\\n', 'Gunga Dass, whom I had begun to regard as my natural protector. Following the\\n', 'impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives, I put my hand into my\\n', 'pocket and drew out four annas. The absurdity of the gift struck me at once,\\n', 'and I was about to replace the money.\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass, however, was of a different opinion. \"Give me the money,\" said he;\\n', '\"all you have, or I will get help, and we will kill you!\" All this as if it\\n', 'were the most natural thing in the world!\\n', '\\n', \"A Briton's first impulse, I believe, is to guard the contents of his pockets;\\n\", \"but a moment's reflection convinced me of the futility of differing with the\\n\", 'one man who had it in his power to make me comfortable; and with whose help it\\n', 'was possible that I might eventually escape from the crater. I gave him all\\n', 'the money in my possession, Rs. 9-8-5--nine rupees eight annas and five pie--\\n', 'for I always keep small change as bakshish when I am in camp. Gunga Dass\\n', 'clutched the coins, and hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth, his\\n', 'expression changing to something diabolical as he looked round to assure\\n', 'himself that no one had observed us.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now I will give you something to eat,\" said he.\\n', '\\n', 'What pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him I am unable\\n', 'to say; but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight I was not sorry that I\\n', 'had parted with it so readily, for I had no doubt that he would have had me\\n', 'killed if I had refused. One does not protest against the vagaries of a den of\\n', 'wild beasts; and my companions were lower than any beasts. While I devoured\\n', 'what Gunga Dass had provided, a coarse chapatti and a cupful of the foul well-\\n', 'water, the people showed not the faintest sign of curiosity--that curiosity\\n', 'which is so rampant, as a rule, in an Indian village.\\n', '\\n', 'I could even fancy that they despised me. At all events they treated me with\\n', 'the most chilling indifference, and Gunga Dass was nearly as bad. I plied him\\n', 'with questions about the terrible village, and received extremely\\n', 'unsatisfactory answers. So far as I could gather, it had been in existence\\n', 'from time immemorial--whence I concluded that it was at least a century old--\\n', 'and during that time no one had ever been known to escape from it. [I had to\\n', 'control myself here with both hands, lest the blind terror should lay hold of\\n', 'me a second time and drive me raving round the crater.] Gunga Dass took a\\n', 'malicious pleasure in emphasizing this point and in watching me wince. Nothing\\n', 'that I could do would induce him to tell me who the mysterious \"They\" were.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is so ordered,\" he would reply, \"and I do not yet know any one who has\\n', 'disobeyed the orders.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Only wait till my servants find that I am missing,\" I retorted, \"and I\\n', 'promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth, and\\n', 'I\\'ll give you a lesson in civility, too, my friend.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place; and,\\n', 'besides, you are dead, my dear friend. It is not your fault, of course, but\\n', 'none the less you are dead and buried.\"\\n', '\\n', 'At irregular intervals supplies of food, I was told, were dropped down from\\n', 'the land side into the amphitheatre, and the inhabitants fought for them like\\n', 'wild beasts. When a man felt his death coming on he retreated to his lair and\\n', 'died there. The body was sometimes dragged out of the hole and thrown on to\\n', 'the sand, or allowed to rot where it lay.\\n', '\\n', 'The phrase \"thrown on to the sand\" caught my attention, and I asked Gunga Dass\\n', 'whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a pestilence.\\n', '\\n', '\"That.\" said he. with another of his wheezy chuckles, \"you may see for\\n', 'yourself subsequently. You will have much time to make observations.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Whereat, to his great delight, I winced once more and hastily continued the\\n', 'conversation :--\"And how do you live here from day to day? What do you do?\"\\n', 'The question elicited exactly the same answer as before coupled with the\\n', 'information that \"this place is like your European heaven; there is neither\\n', 'marrying nor giving in marriage.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass had been educated at a Mission School, and, as he himself admitted,\\n', 'had he only changed his religion \"like a wise man,\" might have avoided the\\n', 'living grave which was now his portion. But as long as I was with him I fancy\\n', 'he was happy.\\n', '\\n', 'Here was a Sahib, a representative of the dominant race, helpless as a child\\n', 'and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors. In a deliberate lazy way\\n', 'he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would devote a rapturous half-hour\\n', 'to watching the agonies of an impaled beetle, or as a ferret in a blind burrow\\n', 'might glue himself comfortably to the neck of a rabbit. The burden of his\\n', 'conversation was that there was no escape \"of no kind whatever,\" and that I\\n', 'should stay here till I died and was \"thrown on to the sand.\" If it were\\n', 'possible to forejudge the conversation of the Damned on the advent of a new\\n', 'soul in their abode, I should say that they would speak as Gunga Dass did to\\n', 'me throughout that long afternoon. I was powerless to protest or answer; all\\n', 'my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable terror that\\n', 'threatened to overwhelm me again and again. I can compare the feeling to\\n', 'nothing except the struggles of a man against the overpowering nausea of the\\n', 'Channel passage--only my agony was of the spirit and infinitely more terrible.\\n', '\\n', 'As the day wore on, the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to catch\\n', 'the rays of the afternoon sun, which were now sloping in at the mouth of the\\n', 'crater. They assembled in little knots, and talked among themselves without\\n', \"even throwing a glance in my direction. About four o'clock, as far as I could\\n\", 'judge Gunga Dass rose and dived into his lair for a moment, emerging with a\\n', 'live crow in his hands. The wretched bird was in a most draggled and\\n', 'deplorable condition, but seemed to be in no way afraid of its master,\\n', 'Advancing cautiously to the river front, Gunga Dass stepped from tussock to\\n', 'tussock until he had reached a smooth patch of sand directly in the line of\\n', \"the boat's fire. The occupants of the boat took no notice. Here he stopped,\\n\", 'and, with a couple of dexterous turns of the wrist, pegged the bird on its\\n', 'back with outstretched wings. As was only natural, the crow began to shriek at\\n', 'once and beat the air with its claws. In a few seconds the clamor had\\n', 'attracted the attention of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards\\n', 'away, where they were discussing something that looked like a corpse. Half a\\n', 'dozen crows flew over at once to see what was going on, and also, as it\\n', 'proved, to attack the pinioned bird. Gunga Dass, who had lain down on a\\n', 'tussock, motioned to me to be quiet, though I fancy this was a needless\\n', 'precaution. In a moment, and before I could see how it happened, a wild crow,\\n', 'who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird, was entangled in the\\n', \"latter's claws, swiftly disengaged by Gunga Dass, and pegged down beside its\\n\", 'companion in adversity. Curiosity, it seemed, overpowered the rest of the\\n', 'flock, and almost before Gunga Dass and I had time to withdraw to the tussock,\\n', 'two more captives were struggling in the upturned claws of the decoys. So the\\n', 'chase--if I can give it so dignified a name--continued until Gunga Dass had\\n', 'captured seven crows. Five of them he throttled at once, reserving two for\\n', 'further operations another day. I was a good deal impressed by this, to me,\\n', 'novel method of securing food, and complimented Gunga Dass on his skill.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is nothing to do,\" said he. \"Tomorrow you must do it for me. You are\\n', 'stronger than I am.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This calm assumption of superiority Upset me not a little, and I answered\\n', 'peremptorily;--\"Indeed, you old ruffian! What do you think I have given you\\n', 'money for?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well,\" was the unmoved reply. \"Perhaps not tomorrow, nor the day after,\\n', 'nor subsequently; but in the end, and for many years, you will catch crows and\\n', 'eat crows, and you will thank your European God that you have crows to catch\\n', 'and eat.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I could have cheerfully strangled him for this; but judged it best under the\\n', 'circumstances to smother my resentment. An hour later I was eating one of the\\n', 'crows; and, as Gunga Dass had said, thanking my God that I had a crow to eat.\\n', 'Never as long as I live shall I forget that evening meal. The whole population\\n', 'were squatting on the hard sand platform opposite their dens, huddled over\\n', 'tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes. Death, having once laid his hand upon\\n', 'these men and forborne to strike, seemed to stand aloof from them now; for\\n', 'most of our company were old men, bent and worn and twisted with years, and\\n', 'women aged to all appearance as the Fates themselves. They sat together in\\n', 'knots and talked--God only knows what they found to discuss--in low equable\\n', 'tones, curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are\\n', 'accustomed to make day hideous. Now and then an access of that sudden fury\\n', 'which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or woman; and\\n', 'with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the steep slope until,\\n', 'baffled and bleeding, he fell back on the platform incapable of moving a limb.\\n', 'The others would never even raise their eyes when this happened, as men too\\n', \"well aware of the futility of their fellows' attempts and wearied with their\\n\", 'useless repetition. I saw four such outbursts in the course of the evening.\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass took an eminently business-like view of my situation, and while we\\n', 'were dining--I can afford to laugh at the recollection now, but it was painful\\n', 'enough at the time- propounded the terms on which he would consent to \"do\" for\\n', 'me. My nine rupees eight annas, he argued, at the rate of three annas a day,\\n', 'would provide me with food for fifty-one days, or about seven weeks; that is\\n', 'to say, he would be willing to cater for me for that length of time. At the\\n', 'end of it I was to look after myself. For a further consideration--videlicet\\n', 'my boots--he would be willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own,\\n', 'and would supply me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare.\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well, Gunga Dass,\" I replied; \"to the first terms I cheerfully agree,\\n', 'but, as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as you sit here\\n', 'and taking everything that you have\" (I thought of the two invaluable crows at\\n', 'the time), \"I flatly refuse to give you my boots and shall take whichever den\\n', 'I please.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The stroke was a bold one, and I was glad when I saw that it had succeeded.\\n', 'Gunga Dass changed his tone immediately, and disavowed all intention of asking\\n', 'for my boots. At the time it did not strike me as at all strange that I, a\\n', \"Civil Engineer, a man of thirteen years' standing in the Service, and, I\\n\", 'trust, an average Englishman, should thus calmly threaten murder and violence\\n', 'against the man who had, for a consideration it is true, taken me under his\\n', 'wing. I had left the world, it seemed, for centuries. I was as certain then as\\n', 'I am now of my own existence, that in the accursed settlement there was no law\\n', 'save that of the strongest; that the living dead men had thrown behind them\\n', 'every canon of the world which had cast them out; and that I had to depend for\\n', 'my own life on my strength and vigilance alone. The crew of the ill-fated\\n', 'Mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of mind. \"At\\n', 'present,\" I argued to myself, \"I am strong and a match for six of these\\n', 'wretches. It is imperatively necessary that I should, for my own sake, keep\\n', 'both health and strength until the hour of my release comes--if it ever does.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Fortified with these resolutions, I ate and drank as much as I could, and made\\n', 'Gunga Dass understand that I intended to be his master, and that the least\\n', 'sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with the only punishment\\n', 'I had it in my power to inflict--sudden and violent death. Shortly after this\\n', 'I went to bed.\\n', '\\n', 'That is to say, Gunga Dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which I\\n', 'thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his, and followed myself,\\n', 'feet foremost; the hole running about nine feet into the sand with a slight\\n', 'downward inclination, and being neatly shored with timbers. From my den, which\\n', 'faced the river-front, I was able to watch the waters of the Sutlej flowing\\n', 'past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to sleep as best I\\n', 'might.\\n', '\\n', 'The horrors of that night I shall never forget. My den was nearly as narrow as\\n', 'a coffin, and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by the contact of\\n', 'innumerable naked bodies, added to which it smelled abominably. Sleep was\\n', 'altogether out of question to one in my excited frame of mind. As the night\\n', 'wore on, it seemed that the entire amphitheatre was filled with legions of\\n', 'unclean devils that, trooping up from the shoals below, mocked the\\n', 'unfortunates in their lairs.\\n', '\\n', 'Personally I am not of an imaginative temperament,--very few Engineers are,--\\n', 'but on that occasion I was as completely prostrated with nervous terror as any\\n', 'woman. After half an hour or so, however, I was able once more to calmly\\n', 'review my chances of escape. Any exit by the steep sand walls was, of course,\\n', 'impracticable. I had been thoroughly convinced of this some time before. It\\n', 'was possible, just possible, that I might, in the uncertain moonlight, safely\\n', 'run the gauntlet of the rifle shots. The place was so full of terror for me\\n', 'that I was prepared to undergo any risk in leaving it. Imagine my delight,\\n', 'then, when after creeping stealthily to the river-front I found that the\\n', 'infernal boat was not there. My freedom lay before me in the next few steps!\\n', '\\n', 'By walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the\\n', 'projecting left horn of the horseshoe, I could wade across, turn the flank of\\n', \"the crater, and make my way inland. Without a moment's hesitation I marched\\n\", 'briskly past the tussocks where Gunga Dass had snared the crows, and out in\\n', 'the direction of the smooth white sand beyond. My first step from the tufts of\\n', 'dried grass showed me how utterly futile was any hope of escape; for, as I put\\n', 'my foot down, I felt an indescribable drawing, sucking motion of the sand\\n', 'below. Another moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee. In the\\n', 'moonlight the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish\\n', 'delight at my disappointment. I struggled clear, sweating with terror and\\n', 'exertion, back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face.\\n', '\\n', 'My only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a quicksand!\\n', '\\n', 'How long I lay I have not the faintest idea; but I was roused at last by the\\n', 'malevolent chuckle of Gunga Dass at my ear. \"I would advise you, Protector of\\n', 'the Poor\" (the ruffian was speaking English) \"to return to your house. It is\\n', 'unhealthy to lie down here. Moreover, when the boat returns, you will most\\n', 'certainly be rifled at.\" He stood over me in the dim light of the dawn,\\n', 'chuckling and laughing to himself. Suppressing my first impulse to catch the\\n', 'man by the neck and throw him on to the quicksand, I rose sullenly and\\n', 'followed him to the platform below the burrows.\\n', '\\n', 'Suddenly, and futilely as I thought while I spoke, I asked--\"Gunga Dass, what\\n', 'is the good of the boat if I can\\'t get out anyhow?\" I recollect that even in\\n', 'my deepest trouble I had been speculating vaguely on the waste of ammunition\\n', 'in guarding an already well protected foreshore.\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass laughed again and made answer:--\"They have the boat only in\\n', 'daytime. It is for the reason that there is a way. I hope we shall have the\\n', 'pleasure of your company for much longer time. It is a pleasant spot when you\\n', 'have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I staggered, numbed and helpless, toward the fetid burrow allotted to me, and\\n', 'fell asleep. An hour or so later I was awakened by a piercing scream--the\\n', 'shrill, high-pitched scream of a horse in pain. Those who have once heard that\\n', 'will never forget the sound. I found some little difficulty in scrambling out\\n', 'of the burrow. When I was in the open, I saw Pornic, my poor old Pornic, lying\\n', 'dead on the sandy soil. How they had killed him I cannot guess.  Gunga Dass\\n', 'explained that horse was better than crow, and \"greatest good of greatest\\n', 'number is political maxim. We are now Republic, Mister Jukes, and you are\\n', 'entitled to a fair share of the beast. If you like, we will pass a vote of\\n', 'thanks. Shall I propose?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Yes, we were a Republic indeed! A Republic of wild beasts penned at the bottom\\n', 'of a pit, to eat and fight and sleep till we died. I attempted no protest of\\n', 'any kind, but sat down and stared at the hideous sight in front of me. In less\\n', \"time almost than it takes me to write this, Pornic's body was divided, in some\\n\", 'unclear way or other; the men and women had dragged the fragments on to the\\n', 'platform and were preparing their normal meal. Gunga Dass cooked mine. The\\n', 'almost irresistible impulse to fly at the sand walls until I was wearied laid\\n', 'hold of me afresh, and I had to struggle against it with all my might. Gunga\\n', 'Dass was offensively jocular till I told him that if he addressed another\\n', 'remark of any kind whatever to me I should strangle him where he sat. This\\n', 'silenced him till silence became insupportable, and I bade him say something.\\n', '\\n', '\"You will live here till you die like the other Feringhi,\" he said, coolly,\\n', 'watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing.\\n', '\\n', '\"What other Sahib, you swine? Speak at once, and don\\'t stop to tell me a lie.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He is over there,\" answered Gunga Dass, pointing to a burrow-mouth about four\\n', 'doors ta the left of my own. \"You can see for yourself. He died in the burrow\\n', 'as you will die, and I will die, and as all these men and women and the one\\n', 'child will also die.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"For pity\\'s sake tell me all you know about him. Who was he? When did he come,\\n', 'and when did he die?\"\\n', '\\n', 'This appeal was a weak step on my part. Gunga Dass only leered and replied:--\\n', '\"I will not--unless you give me something first.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then I recollected where I was, and struck the man between the eyes, partially\\n', 'stunning him. He stepped down from the platform at once, and, cringing and\\n', 'fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet, led me round to the\\n', 'burrow which he had indicated.\\n', '\\n', '\"I know nothing whatever about the gentleman. Your God be my witness that I do\\n', 'not. He was as anxious to escape as you were, and he was shot from the boat,\\n', 'though we all did all things to prevent him from attempting. He was shot\\n', 'here.\" Gunga Dass laid his hand on his lean stomach and bowed to the earth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, and what then? Go on!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And then--and then, Your Honor, we carried him in to his house and gave him\\n', 'water, and put wet cloths on the wound, and he laid down in his house and gave\\n', 'up the ghost.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In how long? In how long?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"About half an hour, after he received his wound. I call Vishnu to witness,\"\\n', 'yelled the wretched man, \"that I did everything for him. Everything which was\\n', 'possible, that I did!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles. But I had my doubts\\n', \"about Gunga Dass's benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay protesting.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I believe you robbed him of everything he had. But I can find out in a minute\\n', 'or two. How long was the Sahib here?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nearly a year and a half. I think he must have gone mad. But hear me swear,\\n', \"Protector of the Poor! Won't Your Honor hear me swear that I never touched an\\n\", 'article that belonged to him? What is Your Worship going to do?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I had taken Gunga Dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the platform\\n', 'opposite the deserted burrow. As I did so I thought of my wretched fellow-\\n', \"prisoner's unspeakable misery among all these horrors for eighteen months, and\\n\", 'the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole, with a bullet-wound in the\\n', 'stomach. Gunga Dass fancied I was going to kill him and howled pitifully. The\\n', 'rest of the population, in the plethora that follows a full flesh meal,\\n', 'watched us without stirring.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go inside, Gunga Dass,\" said I, \"and fetch it out.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was feeling sick and faint with horror now. Gunga Dass nearly rolled off the\\n', 'platform and howled aloud.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I am Brahmin, Sahib--a high-caste Brahmin. By your soul, by your father\\'s\\n', 'soul, do not make me do this thing!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my soul and my father\\'s soul, in you go!\" I said,\\n', 'and, seizing him by the shoulders, I crammed his head into the mouth of the\\n', 'burrow, kicked the rest of him in, and, sitting down, covered my face with my\\n', 'hands.\\n', '\\n', 'At the end of a few minutes I heard a rustle and a creak; then Gunga Dass in a\\n', 'sobbing, choking whisper speaking to himself; then a soft thud--and I\\n', 'uncovered my eyes.\\n', '\\n', 'The dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a yellow-\\n', 'brown mummy. I told Gunga Dass to stand off while I examined it.\\n', '\\n', 'The body--clad in an olive-green hunting-suit much stained and worn, with\\n', 'leather pads on the shoulders--was that of a man between thirty and forty,\\n', 'above middle height, with light, sandy hair, long mustache, and a rough\\n', 'unkempt beard. The left canine of the upper jaw was missing, and a portion of\\n', 'the lobe of the right ear was gone. On the second finger of the left hand was\\n', 'a ring--a shield-shaped bloodstone set in gold, with a monogram that might\\n', 'have been either \"B.K.\" or \"B.L.\" On the third finger of the right hand was a\\n', 'silver ring in the shape of a coiled cobra, much worn and tarnished. Gunga\\n', 'Dass deposited a handful of trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my\\n', 'feet, and, covering the face of the body with my handkerchief, I turned to\\n', 'examine these. I give the full list in the hope that it may lead to the\\n', 'identification of the unfortunate man:\\n', '\\n', '1. Bowl of a briarwood pipe, serrated at the edge; much worn and blackened;\\n', 'bound with string at the crew.\\n', '\\n', '2. Two patent-lever keys; wards of both broken.\\n', '\\n', '3. Tortoise-shell-handled penknife, silver or nickel name-plate, marked with\\n', 'monogram \"B.K.\"\\n', '\\n', '4. Envelope, postmark Undecipherable, bearing a Victorian stamp, addressed to\\n', '\"Miss Mon-\" (rest illegible) -\"ham\"-\"nt.\"\\n', '\\n', '5. Imitation crocodile-skin notebook with pencil.  First forty-five pages\\n', 'blank; four and a half illegible; fifteen others filled with private memoranda\\n', 'relating chiefly to three persons--a Mrs. L. Singleton, abbreviated several\\n', 'times to \"Lot Single,\" \"Mrs. S. May,\" and \"Garmison,\" referred to in places as\\n', '\"Jerry\" or \"Jack.\"\\n', '\\n', \"6.Handle of small-sized hunting-knife. Blade snapped short. Buck's horn,\\n\", 'diamond cut, with swivel and ring on the butt; fragment of cotton cord\\n', 'attached.\\n', '\\n', 'It must not be supposed that I inventoried all these things on the spot as\\n', 'fully as I have here written them down. The notebook first attracted my\\n', 'attention, and I put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later on.\\n', '\\n', \"The rest of the articles I conveyed to my burrow for safety's sake, and there\\n\", 'being a methodical man, I inventoried them. I then returned to the corpse and\\n', 'ordered Gunga Dass to help me to carry it out to the river-front. While we\\n', 'were engaged in this, the exploded shell of an old brown cartridge dropped out\\n', 'of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet. Gunga Dass had not seen it; and I\\n', 'fell to thinking that a man does not carry exploded cartridge-cases,\\n', 'especially \"browns,\" which will not bear loading twice, about with him when\\n', 'shooting. In other words, that cartridge-case had been fired inside the\\n', 'crater. Consequently there must be a gun somewhere. I was on the verge of\\n', 'asking Gunga Dass, but checked myself, knowing that he would lie. We laid the\\n', 'body down on the edge of the quicksand by the tussocks. It was my intention to\\n', 'push it out and let it be swallowed up--the only possible mode of burial that\\n', 'I could think of. I ordered Gunga Dass to go away.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand. In doing so--it was lying\\n', 'face downward--I tore the frail and rotten khaki shooting-coat open,\\n', 'disclosing a hideous cavity in the back. I have already told you that the dry\\n', \"sand had, as it were, mummified the body. A moment's glance showed that the\\n\", 'gaping hole had been caused by a gun-shot wound; the gun must have been fired\\n', 'with the muzzle almost touching the back. The shooting-coat, being intact, had\\n', 'been drawn over the body after death, which must have been instantaneous. The\\n', \"secret of the poor wretch's death was plain to me in a flash. Some one of the\\n\", 'crater, presumably Gunga Dass, must have shot him with his own gun--the gun\\n', 'that fitted the brown cartridges. He had never attempted to escape in the face\\n', 'of the rifle-fire from the boat.\\n', '\\n', 'I pushed the corpse out hastily, and saw it sink from sight literally in a few\\n', 'seconds. I shuddered as I watched. In a dazed, half-conscious way I turned to\\n', 'peruse the notebook. A stained and discolored slip of paper bad been inserted\\n', 'between the binding and the back, and dropped out as I opened the pages. This\\n', 'is what it contained:--\"Four out from crow-clump: three left; nine out; two\\n', 'right; three back; two left; fourteen out; two left; seven out; one left; nine\\n', 'back; two right; six back; four right; seven back.\" The paper had been burned\\n', 'and charred at the edges. What it meant I could not understand. I sat down on\\n', 'the dried bents turning it over and over between my fingers, until I was aware\\n', 'of Gunga Dass standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and\\n', 'outstretched hands.\\n', '\\n', '\"Have you got it?\" he panted. \"Will you not let me look at it also? I swear\\n', 'that I will return it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Got what?  Return what?\" asked.\\n', '\\n', '\"That which you have in your hands. It will help us both.\" He stretched out\\n', 'his long, bird-like talons, trembling with eagerness.\\n', '\\n', '\"I could never find it,\" he continued. \"He had secreted it about his person.\\n', 'Therefore I shot him, but nevertheless I was unable to obtain it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Gunga Dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the rifle-bullet. I\\n', 'received the information perfectly calmly. Morality is blunted by consorting\\n', 'with the Dead who are alive.\\n', '\\n', '\"What on earth are you raving about? What is it you want me to give you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The piece of paper in the notebook. It will help us both. Oh, you fool! You\\n', 'fool! Can you not see what it will do for us? We shall escape!\"\\n', '\\n', 'His voice rose almost to a scream, and he danced with excitement before me. I\\n', 'own I was moved at the chance of my getting away.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t skip! Explain yourself. Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will\\n', 'help us? What does it mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Read it aloud! Read it aloud! I beg and I pray you to read it aloud.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I did so. Gunga Dass listened delightedly, and drew an irregular line in the\\n', 'sand with his fingers.\\n', '\\n', '\"See now! It was the length of his gun-barrels without the stock. I have those\\n', 'barrels. Four gun-barrels out from the place where I caught crows straight\\n', 'out; do you follow me? Then three left--Ah! how well I remember when that man\\n', 'worked it out night after night Then nine out, and so on. Out is always\\n', 'straight before you across the quicksand. He told me so before I killed him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But if you knew all this why didn\\'t you get out before?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not know it. He told me that he was working it out a year and a half\\n', 'ago, and how he was working it out night after night when the boat had gone\\n', 'away, and he could get out near the quicksand safely. Then he said that we\\n', 'would get away together. But I was afraid that he would leave me behind one\\n', 'night when he had worked it all out, and so I shot him. Besides, it is not\\n', 'advisable that the men who once get in here should escape. Only I, and I am a\\n', 'Brahmin.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The prospect of escape had brought Gunga Dass's caste back to him. He stood\\n\", 'up, walked about and gesticulated violently. Eventually I managed to make him\\n', 'talk soberly, and he told me how this Englishman had spent six months night\\n', 'after night in exploring, inch by inch, the passage across the quicksand; how\\n', 'he had declared it to be simplicity itself up to within about twenty yards of\\n', 'the river bank after turning the flank of the left horn of the horseshoe. This\\n', 'much he had evidently not completed when Gunga Dass shot him with his own gun.\\n', '\\n', 'In my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape I recollect shaking\\n', 'hands effusively with Gunga Dass, after we had decided that we were to make an\\n', 'attempt to get away that very night. It was weary work waiting throughout the\\n', 'afternoon.\\n', '\\n', \"About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge, when the Moon had just risen above\\n\", 'the lip of the crater, Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to bring out the\\n', 'gun-barrels whereby to measure our path. All the other wretched inhabitants\\n', 'had retired to their lairs long ago. The guardian boat drifted downstream some\\n', 'hours before, and we were utterly alone by the crow-clump. Gunga Dass, while\\n', 'carrying the gun-barrels, let slip the piece of paper which was to be our\\n', 'guide. I stooped down hastily to recover it, and, as I did so, I was aware\\n', 'that the diabolical Brahmin was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head\\n', 'with the gun-barrels. It was too late to turn round. I must have received the\\n', 'blow somewhere on the nape of my neck. A hundred thousand fiery stars danced\\n', 'before my eyes, and I fell forwards senseless at the edge of, the quicksand.\\n', '\\n', 'When I recovered consciousness, the Moon was going down, and I was sensible of\\n', 'intolerable pain in the back of my head. Gunga Dass had disappeared and my\\n', 'mouth was full of blood. I lay down again and prayed that I might die without\\n', 'more ado. Then the unreasoning fury which I had before mentioned, laid hold\\n', 'upon me, and I staggered inland toward the walls of the crater. It seemed that\\n', 'some one was calling to me in a whisper--\"Sahib! Sahib! Sahib!\" exactly as my\\n', 'bearer used to call me in the morning I fancied that I was delirious until a\\n', 'handful of sand fell at my feet. Then I looked up and saw a head peering down\\n', 'into the amphitheatre--the head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who attended to my\\n', 'collies. As soon as he had attracted my attention, he held up his hand and\\n', 'showed a rope. I motioned. staggering to and fro for the while, that he should\\n', 'throw it down. It was a couple of leather punkah-ropes knotted together, with\\n', 'a loop at one end. I slipped the loop over my head and under my arms; heard\\n', 'Dunnoo urge something forward; was conscious that I was being dragged, face\\n', 'downward, up the steep sand slope, and the next instant found myself choked\\n', 'and half fainting on the sand hills overlooking the crater. Dunnoo, with his\\n', 'face ashy grey in the moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my\\n', 'tent at once.\\n', '\\n', \"It seems that he had tracked Pornic's footprints fourteen miles across the\\n\", 'sands to the crater; had returned and told my servants, who flatly refused to\\n', 'meddle with any one, white or black, once fallen into the hideous Village of\\n', 'the Dead; whereupon Dunnoo had taken one of my ponies and a couple of punkah-\\n', 'ropes, returned to the crater, and hauled me out as I have described.\\n', '\\n', 'To cut a long story short, Dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold mohur a\\n', 'month--a sum which I still think far too little for the services he has\\n', 'rendered. Nothing on earth will induce me to go near that devilish spot again,\\n', 'or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than I have done.

They do not understand that nobody cares a straw for the\\n', 'internal administration of Native States so long as oppression and crime are\\n', 'kept within decent limits, and the ruler is not drugged, drunk, or diseased\\n', 'from one end of the year to the other. They are the dark places of the earth,\\n', 'full of unimaginable cruelty, touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one\\n', 'side, and, on the other, the days of Harun-al-Raschid. When I left the train I\\n', 'did business with divers Kings, and in eight days passed through many changes\\n', 'of life. Sometimes I wore dress-clothes and consorted with Princes and\\n', 'Politicals, drinking from crystal and eating from silver. Sometimes I lay out\\n', 'upon the ground and devoured what I could get, from a plate made of leaves,\\n', 'and drank the running water, and slept under the same rug as my servant.

The Bombay\\n', 'Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar. She arrived just as I got in,\\n', 'and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the carriages. There\\n', 'was only one Second-class on the train. I slipped the window and looked down\\n', 'upon a flaming-red beard, half covered by a railway-rug. That was my man, fast\\n', 'asleep, and I dug him gently in the ribs.\\n', '\\n', 'He woke with a grunt, and I saw his face in the light of the lamps.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a great and shining face.\\n', '\\n', '\"Tickets again?\" said he.\\n', '\\n', '\"No,\" said I. \"I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week.

I therefore took\\n', 'some trouble to describe them as accurately as I could remember to people who\\n', 'would be interested in deporting them; and succeeded, so I was later informed,\\n', 'in having them headed back from the Degumber borders.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I became respectable, and returned to an office where there were no Kings\\n', 'and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper. A newspaper\\n', 'office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person, to the prejudice of\\n', 'discipline. Zenana-mission ladies arrive, and beg that the Editor will\\n', 'instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian prize-giving in a\\n', 'back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village; Colonels who have been\\n', 'overpassed for command sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten,\\n', 'twelve, or twenty- four leading articles on Seniority versus Selection;\\n', 'missionaries wish to know why they have not been permitted to escape from\\n', 'their regular vehicles of abuse, and swear at a brother missionary under\\n', 'special patronage of the editorial We. Stranded theatrical companies troop up\\n', 'to explain that they cannot pay for their advertisements, but on their return\\n', 'from New Zealand or Tahiti will do so with interest; inventors of patent\\n', 'punka-pulling machines, carriage couplings, and unbreakable swords and\\n', 'axletrees call with specifications in their pockets and hours at their\\n', 'disposal; tea companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office\\n', 'pens; secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last\\n', 'dance more fully described; strange ladies rustle in and say, \"I want a\\n', 'hundred lady\\'s cards printed at once, please,\" which is manifestly part of an\\n', \"Editor's duty; and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the Grand Trunk\\n\", 'Road makes it his business to ask for employment as a proof-reader. And, all\\n', 'the time, the telephone-bell is ringing madly, and Kings are being killed on\\n', 'the Continent, and Empires are saying, \"You\\'re another,\" and Mister Gladstone\\n', 'is calling down brimstone upon the British Dominions, and the little black\\n', 'copyboys are whining, \"kaa-pi chay-ha-yeh\" (\"Copy wanted\"), like tired bees,\\n', \"and most of the paper is as blank as Modred's shield.\\n\", '\\n', 'But that is the amusing part of the year.

A few great men had\\n', 'died in the past two years, the machines worked with more clatter, and some of\\n', 'the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller. But that was all the\\n', 'difference.\\n', '\\n', 'I passed over to the press-room, and went through just such a scene as I have\\n', 'already described. The nervous tension was stronger than it had been two years\\n', 'before, and I felt the heat more acutely. At three o\\'clock I cried, \"Print\\n', 'off,\" and turned to go, when there crept to my chair what was left of a man.\\n', 'He was bent into a circle, his head was sunk between his shoulders, and he\\n', 'moved his feet one over the other like a bear.

Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over the\\n', 'nose in an inch-broad black band, but for the life of me I could not tell\\n', 'where.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know you,\" I said, handing him the whisky. \"What can I do for you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He took a gulp of the spirit raw, and shivered in spite of the suffocating\\n', 'heat.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve come back,\" he repeated; \"and I was the King of Kafiristan--me and\\n', 'Dravot--crowned Kings we was!

I am Peachey,--Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan,--and\\n', 'you\\'ve been setting here ever since--O Lord!\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was more than a little astonished, and expressed my feelings accordingly.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s true,\" said Carnehan, with a dry cackle, nursing his feet, which were\\n', 'wrapped in rags--\"true as gospel. Kings we were, with crowns upon our heads--\\n', 'me and Dravot--poor Dan--oh, poor, poor Dan, that would never take advice, not\\n', 'though I begged of him!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Take the whisky,\" I said, \"and take your own time.

Look at me,\" said Carnehan. \"That comes afterward, but\\n', \"for the Lord's sake don't distrack me. We left with that caravan, me and\\n\", 'Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with. Dravot\\n', 'used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their\\n', 'dinners--cooking their dinners, and . . . what did they do then? They lit\\n', \"little fires with sparks that went into Dravot's beard, and we all laughed--\\n\", \"fit to die.

To Jagdallak, where you turned off to try to get into\\n', 'Kafiristan.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, we didn\\'t, neither. What are you talking about? We turned off before\\n', \"Jagdallak, because we heard the roads was good. But they wasn't good enough\\n\", \"for our two camels--mine and Dravot's. When we left the caravan, Dravot took\\n\", 'off all his clothes and mine too, and said we would be heathen, because the\\n', \"Kafirs didn't allow Mohammedans to talk to them. So we dressed betwixt and\\n\", 'between, and such a sight as Daniel Dravot I never saw yet nor expect to see\\n', 'again. He burned half his beard, and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder, and\\n', 'shaved his head into patterns. He shaved mine too, and made me wear outrageous\\n', 'things to look like a heathen. That was in a most mountaineous country, and\\n', \"our camels couldn't go along any more because of the mountains. They were tall\\n\", 'and black, and coming home I saw them fight like wild goats--there are lots of\\n', 'goats in Kafiristan. And these mountains, they never keep still, no more than\\n', 'the goats. Always fighting they are, and don\\'t let you sleep at night.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Take some more whisky,\" I said, very slowly. \"What did you and Daniel Dravot\\n', 'do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads that led\\n', 'into Kafiristan?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What did which do? There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan that\\n', 'was with Dravot. Shall I tell you about him? He died out there in the cold.\\n', 'Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey, turning and twisting in the air like a\\n', 'penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir. No; they was two for three\\n', \"ha'pence, those whirligigs, or I am much mistaken and woful sore... And then\\n\", \"these camels were no use, and Peachey said to Dravot, 'For the Lord's sake\\n\", \"let's get out of this before our heads are chopped off,' and with that they\\n\", 'killed the camels all among the mountains, not having anything in particular\\n', 'to eat, but first they took off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition,\\n', 'till two men came along driving four mules. Dravot up and dances in front of\\n', \"them, singing, 'Sell me four mules.' Says the first man, 'If you are rich\\n\", \"enough to buy, you are rich enough to rob;' but before ever he could put his\\n\", 'hand to his knife, Dravot breaks his neck over his knee, and the other party\\n', 'runs away. So Carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the\\n', 'camels, and together we starts forward into those bitter-cold mountaineous\\n', 'parts, and never a road broader than the back of your hand.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He paused for a moment, while I asked him if he could remember the nature of\\n', 'the country through which he had journeyed.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am telling you as straight as I can, but my head isn\\'t as good as it might\\n', 'be. They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot died. The\\n', 'country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary, and the inhabitants\\n', 'was dispersed and solitary. They went up and up, and down and down, and that\\n', 'other party, Carnehan, was imploring of Dravot not to sing and whistle so\\n', 'loud, for fear of bringing down the tremenjus avalanches. But Dravot says that\\n', \"if a King couldn't sing it wasn't worth being King, and whacked the mules over\\n\", 'the rump, and never took no heed for ten cold days. We came to a big level\\n', 'valley all among the mountains, and the mules were near dead, so we killed\\n', 'them, not having anything in special for them or us to eat. We sat upon the\\n', 'boxes, and played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley, chasing twenty men\\n', 'with bows and arrows, and the row was tremenjus.\\n', '\\n', '\"They was fair men--fairer than you or me--with yellow hair and remarkable\\n', \"well built. Says Dravot, unpacking the guns, 'This is the beginning of the\\n\", \"business. We'll fight for the ten men,' and with that he fires two rifles at\\n\", 'the twenty men, and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock where\\n', 'he was sitting. The other men began to run, but Carnehan and Dravot sits on\\n', 'the boxes picking them off at all ranges, up and down the valley. Then we goes\\n', 'up to the ten men that had run across the snow too, and they fires a footy\\n', 'little arrow at us. Dravot he shoots above their heads, and they all falls\\n', 'down flat. Then he walks over them and kicks them, and then he lifts them up\\n', 'and shakes hands all round to make them friendly like. He calls them and gives\\n', 'them the boxes to carry, and waves his hand for all the world as though he was\\n', 'King already. They takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill\\n', 'into a pine wood on the top, where there was half a dozen big stone idols.\\n', 'Dravot he goes to the biggest--a fellow they call Imbra--and lays a rifle and\\n', 'a cartridge at his feet, rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nose,\\n', \"patting him on the head, and nods his head, and says, 'That's all right. I'm\\n\", \"in the know too, and these old jimjams are my friends.' Then he opens his\\n\", 'mouth and points down it, and when the first man brings him food, he says,\\n', \"'No;' and when the second man brings him food, he says 'no;' but when one of\\n\", \"the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food, he says, 'Yes;'\\n\", 'very haughty, and eats it slow. That was how he came to our first village\\n', 'without any trouble, just as though we had tumbled from the skies. But we\\n', \"tumbled from one of those damned rope-bridges, you see, and--you couldn't\\n\", 'expect a man to laugh much after that?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Take some more whisky and go on,\" I said. \"That was the first village you\\n', 'came into. How did you get to be King?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wasn\\'t King,\" said Carnehan. \"Dravot he was the King, and a handsome man he\\n', 'looked with the gold crown on his head and all. Him and the other party stayed\\n', 'in that village, and every morning Dravot sat by the side of old Imbra, and\\n', \"the people came and worshipped. That was Dravot's order. Then a lot of men\\n\", 'came into the valley, and Carnehan Dravot picks them off with the rifles\\n', 'before they knew where they was, and runs down into the valley and up again\\n', 'the other side, and finds another village, same as the first one, and the\\n', \"people all falls down flat on their faces, and Dravot says, 'Now what is the\\n\", \"trouble between you two villages?' and the people points to a woman, as fair\\n\", 'as you or me, that was carried off, and Dravot takes her back to the first\\n', 'village and counts up the dead--eight there was. For each dead man Dravot\\n', 'pours a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig, and\\n', \"'That's all right,' says he. Then he and Carnehan takes the big boss of each\\n\", 'village by the arm, and walks them down the valley, and shows them how to\\n', 'scratch a line with a spear right down the valley, and gives each a sod of\\n', 'turf from both sides of the line. Then all the people comes down and shouts\\n', \"like the devil and all, and Dravot says, 'Go and dig the land, and be fruitful\\n\", \"and multiply,' which they did, though they didn't understand. Then we asks the\\n\", 'names of things in their lingo--bread and water and fire and idols and such;\\n', 'and Dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol, and says he must\\n', 'sit there and judge the people, and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot.\\n', '\\n', '\"Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees and\\n', 'much prettier, and the priests heard all the complaints and told Dravot in\\n', \"dumb-show what it was about. 'That's just the beginning,' says Dravot. 'They\\n\", \"think we're Gods.' He and Carnehan picks out twenty good men and shows them\\n\", 'how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line; and they was very\\n', 'pleased to do so, and clever to see the hang of it. Then he takes out his pipe\\n', 'and his baccy-pouch, and leaves one at one village and one at the other, and\\n', 'off we two goes to see what was to be done in the next valley. That was all\\n', \"rock, and there was a little village there, and Carnehan says, 'Send 'em to\\n\", \"the old valley to plant,' and takes 'em there and gives 'em some land that\\n\", \"wasn't took before. They were a poor lot, and we blooded 'em with a kid before\\n\", \"letting 'em into the new Kingdom. That was to impress the people, and then\\n\", 'they settled down quiet, and Carnehan went back to Dravot, who had got into\\n', 'another valley, all snow and ice and most mountaineous.\\n', '\\n', '\"There was no people there, and the Army got afraid; so Dravot shoots one of\\n', 'them, and goes on till he finds some people in a village, and the Army\\n', 'explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot\\n', 'their little matchlocks, for they had matchlocks. We makes friends with the\\n', 'priest, and I stays there alone with two of the Army, teaching the men how to\\n', 'drill; and a thundering big Chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and\\n', 'horns twanging, because he heard there was a new God kicking about. Carnehan\\n', 'sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of\\n', 'them. Then he sends a message to the Chief that, unless he wished to be\\n', 'killed, he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind. The\\n', 'Chief comes alone first, and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his\\n', 'arms about, same as Dravot used, and very much surprised that Chief was, and\\n', 'strokes my eyebrows. Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief, and asks him in\\n', \"dumb-show if he had an enemy he hated. 'I have,' says the chief. So Carnehan\\n\", 'weeds out the pick of his men, and sets the two of the Army to show them\\n', 'drill, and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about as well as\\n', 'Volunteers. So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain on the top of a\\n', \"mountain, and the Chief's men rushes into a village and takes it, we three\\n\", 'Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy. So we took that village too, and\\n', \"I gives the Chief a rag from my coat, and says, 'Occupy till I come;' which\\n\", 'was scriptural. By way of a reminder, when me and the Army was eighteen\\n', 'hundred yards away, I drops a bullet near him standing on the snow, and all\\n', 'the people falls flat on their faces. Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever\\n', 'he be by land or by sea.\"\\n', '\\n', 'At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted: \"How could\\n', 'you write a letter up yonder?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The letter?--oh!--the letter! Keep looking at me between the eyes, please. It\\n', \"was a string-talk letter, that we'd learned the way of it from a blind beggar\\n\", 'in the Punjab.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a knotted\\n', 'twig, and a piece of string which he wound round the twig according to some\\n', 'cipher of his own. He could, after the lapse of days or hours, repeat the\\n', 'sentence which he had reeled up.\\n', '\\n', 'He had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds, and tried to teach me\\n', 'his method, but I could not understand.\\n', '\\n', '\"I sent that letter to Dravot,\" said Carnehan, \"and told him to come back\\n', 'because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle; and then I struck\\n', 'for the first valley, to see how the priests were working. They called the\\n', 'village we took along with the Chief, Bashkai, and the first village we took,\\n', 'Er-Heb. The priests at Er-Heb was doing all right, but they had a lot of\\n', 'pending cases about land to show me, and some men from another village had\\n', 'been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked for that village, and fired\\n', 'four rounds at it from a thousand yards. That used all the cartridges I cared\\n', 'to spend, and I waited for Dravot, who had been away two or three months, and\\n', 'I kept my people quiet.\\n', '\\n', '\"One morning I heard the devil\\'s own noise of drums and horns, and Dan Dravot\\n', 'marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of men, and, which\\n', \"was the most amazing, a great gold crown on his head.

He was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations. I met him in a\\n', 'public billiard-saloon where the marker called him by his given name, and he\\n', 'called the marker \"Bulls-eyes.\" Charley explained, a little nervously, that he\\n', 'had only come to the place to look on, and since looking on at games of skill\\n', 'is not a cheap amusement for the young, I suggested that Charlie should go\\n', 'back to his mother.\\n', '\\n', 'That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on me\\n', 'sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his fellow-\\n', 'clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must, he told me\\n', 'of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to make himself an\\n', 'undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not above sending stories of\\n', 'love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot journals. It was my fate to sit\\n', 'still while Charlie read me poems of many hundred lines, and bulky fragments\\n', 'of plays that would surely shake the world. My reward was his unreserved\\n', 'confidence, and the self-revelations and troubles of a young man are almost as\\n', 'holy as those of a maiden.\\n', '\\n', 'Charlie had never fallen in love, but was anxious to do so on the first\\n', 'opportunity; he believed in all things good and all things honorable, but, at\\n', 'the same time, was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way about\\n', 'the world as befitted a bank clerk on twenty-five shillings a week.  He rhymed\\n', '\"dove\" with \"love\" and \"moon\" with \"June,\" and devoutly believed that they had\\n', 'never so been rhymed before. The long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with\\n', 'hasty words of apology and description and swept on, seeing all that he\\n', 'intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already done, and turned to me\\n', 'for applause.\\n', '\\n', 'I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations, and I know that his\\n', 'writing-table at home was the edge of his washstand.

I looked at him,\\n', 'and wondering whether it were possible, that he did not know the originality,\\n', 'the power of the notion that had come in his way?

But Charlie babbled on serenely, interrupting the\\n', 'current of pure fancy with samples of horrible sentences that he purposed to\\n', 'use. I heard him out to the end. It would be folly to allow his idea to remain\\n', 'in his own inept hands, when I could do so much with it.

Even a woman in her blindest\\n', 'devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores, tilt her bonnet to\\n', 'the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech with his pet\\n', 'oaths.

Business is business,\\n', 'and you may be sure I shouldn\\'t give that price unless--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, if you put it that way,\" said Charlie, visibly moved by the thought of\\n', 'the books. The bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at\\n', 'unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed, should\\n', 'have a table of his own to write at, and unquestioned right to inflict upon me\\n', 'all his poems and fragments of poems. Then I said, \"Now tell me how you came\\n', 'by this idea.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It came by itself.\" Charlie\\'s eyes opened a little.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read\\n', 'before somewhere.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I haven\\'t any time for reading, except when you let me sit here, and on\\n', \"Sundays I'm on my bicycle or down the river all day.

How did he live?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He was on the lower deck of this ship-thing that I was telling you about.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What sort of ship?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It was the kind rowed with oars, and the sea spurts through the oar-holes and\\n', \"the men row sitting up to their knees in water.

There\\'s a rope running overhead, looped to the upper deck,\\n', 'for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls. When the overseer\\n', 'misses the rope once and falls among the rowers, remember the hero laughs at\\n', 'him and gets licked for it. He\\'s chained to his oar of course--the hero.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How is he chained?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"With an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on, and a sort\\n', \"of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar.

Now you listen to me. The long oars on the\\n', 'upper deck are managed by four men to each bench, the lower ones by three, and\\n', \"the lowest of all by two.

When a man dies at his oar on that deck he isn't thrown\\n\", 'overboard, but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the oar-hole in little\\n', 'pieces.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why?\" I demanded, amazed, not so much at the information as the tone of\\n', 'command in which it was flung out.\\n', '\\n', '\"To save trouble and to frighten the others. It needs two overseers to drag a\\n', \"man's body up to the top deck; and if the men at the lower deck oars were left\\n\", \"alone, of course they'd stop rowing and try to pull up the benches by all\\n\", 'standing up together in their chains.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'ve a most provident imagination. Where have you been reading about\\n', 'galleys and galley-slaves?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nowhere that I remember. I row a little when I get the chance.

He misconstrued both into respect for the present\\n', 'soul of Charlie Mears, to whom life was as new as it was to Adam, and interest\\n', 'in his readings; and stretched my patience to breaking point by reciting\\n', 'poetry--not his own now, but that of others. I wished every English poet\\n', 'blotted out of the memory of mankind.

I could hear the water sizzle, and we spun round like\\n', 'a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, that there was a galley coming up\\n', 'bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could just lift up my head and see her\\n', 'sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to meet her bow to bow, but it was too late.\\n', 'We could only turn a little bit because the galley on our right had hooked\\n', 'herself on to us and stopped our moving. Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our\\n', \"left oars began to break as the other galley, the moving one y'know, stuck her\\n\", 'nose into them.

A man of my acquaintance had once gone\\n', 'down with a leaking ship in a still sea, and had seen the water-level pause\\n', 'for an instant ere it fell on the deck.\\n', '\\n', '\"It looked just like a banjo-string drawn tight, and it seemed to stay there\\n', 'for years,\" said Charlie.\\n', '\\n', 'Exactly! The other man had said: \"It looked like a silver wire laid down along\\n', 'the bulwarks, and I thought it was never going to break.\" He had paid\\n', 'everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of knowledge,\\n', 'and I had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and take his knowledge\\n', 'at second hand. But Charlie, the bank-clerk, on twenty-five shillings a week,\\n', 'he who had never been out of sight of a London omnibus, knew it all. It was no\\n', 'consolation to me that once in his lives he had been forced to die for his\\n', 'gains. I also must have died scores of times, but behind me, because I could\\n', 'have used my knowledge, the doors were shut.\\n', '\\n', '\"And then?\" I said, trying to put away the devil of envy.\\n', '\\n', '\"The funny thing was, though, in all the mess I didn\\'t feel a bit astonished\\n', \"or frightened. It seemed as if I'd been in a good many fights, because I told\\n\", 'my next man so when the row began. But that cad of an overseer on my deck\\n', \"wouldn't unloose our chains and give us a chance. He always said that we'd all\\n\", 'he set free after a battle, but we never were; We never were.\" Charlie shook\\n', 'his head mournfully.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a scoundrel!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should say he was. He never gave us enough to eat, and sometimes we were so\\n', \"thirsty that we used to drink salt-water. I can taste that salt-water still.''\\n\", '\\n', '\"Now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I didn\\'t dream about that. I know it was a harbor, though; because we were\\n', 'tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone under water\\n', 'was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped when the tide made us\\n', 'rock.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s curious. Our hero commanded the galley? Didn\\'t he?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Didn\\'t he just! He stood by the bows and shouted like a good \\'un. He was the\\n', 'man who killed the overseer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you were all drowned together, Charlie, weren\\'t you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can\\'t make that fit quite,\" he said with a puzzled look. \"The galley must\\n', 'have gone down with all hands and yet I fancy that the hero went on living\\n', \"afterward. Perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship. I wouldn't see that, of\\n\", 'course. I was dead, you know.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more.\\n', '\\n', 'I did not press him further, but to satisfy myself that he lay in ignorance of\\n', 'the workings of his own mind, deliberately introduced him to Mortimer\\n', 'Collins\\'s \"Transmigration,\" and gave him a sketch of the plot before he opened\\n', 'the pages.\\n', '\\n', '\"What rot it all is!\" he said, frankly, at the end of an hour. \"I don\\'t\\n', 'understand his nonsense about the Red Planet Mars and the King, and the rest\\n', 'of it. Chuck me the Longfellow again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I handed him the book and wrote out as much as I could remember of his\\n', 'description of the sea-fight, appealing to him from time to time for\\n', 'confirmation of fact or detail. He would answer without raising his eyes from\\n', 'the book, as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint on the\\n', 'printed page. I spoke under the normal key of my voice that the current might\\n', 'not be broken, and I know that he was not aware of what he was saying, for his\\n', 'thoughts were out on the sea with Longfellow.\\n', '\\n', '\"Charlie,\" I asked, \"when the rowers on the galleys mutinied how did they kill\\n', 'their overseers?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Tore up the benches and brained \\'em. That happened when a heavy sea was\\n', 'running. An overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and fell\\n', 'among the rowers. They choked him to death against the side of the ship with\\n', 'their chained hands quite quietly, and it was too dark for the other overseer\\n', 'to see what had happened. When he asked, he was pulled down too and choked,\\n', 'and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck, with the pieces of the\\n', 'broken benches banging behind \\'em. How they howled!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what happened after that?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know. The hero went away--red hair and red beard and all.

When next I met him it was in\\n', 'Gracechurch Street with a billbook chained to his waist.\\n', '\\n', 'Business took him over London Bridge and I accompanied him.

But what in the world could a Greek slave know of that\\n', 'affair? I wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the\\n', 'mystery, and the more I considered it, the more baffling it grew. One thing\\n', 'only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the moment. If\\n', 'I came to full knowledge of anything at all, it would not be one life of the\\n', \"soul in Charlie Mears's body, but half a dozen--half a dozen several and\\n\", 'separate existences spent on blue water in the morning of the world!\\n', '\\n', 'Then I walked round the situation.\\n', '\\n', 'Obviously if I used my knowledge I should stand alone and unapproachable until\\n', 'all men were as wise as myself.

If Charlie were permitted full recollection for one\\n', 'hour--for sixty short minutes--of existences that had extended over a thousand\\n', 'years--I would forego all profit and honor from all that I should make of his\\n', 'speech.

Nay, I would make other men believe that they\\n', 'had written it. They would hire bull-hided self-advertising Englishmen to\\n', 'bellow it abroad. Preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it,\\n', 'swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from all\\n', 'mankind. Every Orientalist in Europe would patronize it discursively with\\n', 'Sanskrit and Pali texts.

Between the hailing and re-starting of an omnibus I foresaw the\\n', 'scuffles that would arise among half a dozen denominations all professing \"the\\n', 'doctrine of the True Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Era\";\\n', 'and saw, too, the respectable English newspapers shying, like frightened kine,\\n', 'over the beautiful simplicity of the tale. The mind leaped forward a hundred--\\n', 'two hundred--a thousand years. I saw with sorrow that men would mutilate and\\n', 'garble the story; that rival creeds would turn it upside down till, at last,\\n', 'the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely than the\\n', 'hope of life, would set it aside as an interesting superstition and stampede\\n', 'after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether new. Upon this I\\n', 'changed the terms of the bargain that I would make with the Lords of Life and\\n', 'Death.

The flaming colors of an Aquarium poster caught my eye\\n', 'and I wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure Charlie into the\\n', 'hands of the professional mesmerist, and whether, if he were under his power,\\n', 'he would speak of his past lives. If he did, and if people believed him--but\\n', 'Charlie would be frightened and flustered, or made conceited by the\\n', 'interviews. In either case he would begin to lie, through fear or vanity. He\\n', 'was safest in my own hands.\\n', '\\n', '\"They are very funny fools, your English,\" said a voice at my elbow, and\\n', 'turning round I recognized a casual acquaintance, a young Bengali law student,\\n', 'called Grish Chunder, whose father had sent him to England to become\\n', 'civilized.

The devil prompted me to speak.\\n', '\\n', '\"Why, \\'of course,\\' Charlie?\" said I. \"I don\\'t know. Are you making fun of me?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The current was broken for the time being. I took up a notebook and pretended\\n', 'to make many entries in it.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself,\" I said after\\n', 'a pause. \"The way that you\\'ve brought out the character of the hero is simply\\n', 'wonderful.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you think so?\" he answered, with a pleased flush. \"I often tell myself\\n', 'that there\\'s more in me than my--than people think.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s an enormous amount in you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then, won\\'t you let me send an essay on The Ways of Bank Clerks to Tit-Bits,\\n', 'and get the guinea prize?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That wasn\\'t exactly what I meant, old fellow: perhaps it would be better to\\n', 'wait a little and go ahead with the galley-story.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Ah, but I sha\\'n\\'t get the credit of that.

Therefore he was deeply\\n', 'interested in guinea competitions. Remembering what Grish Chunder had said I\\n', 'laughed aloud. The Lords of Life and Death would never allow Charlie Mears to\\n', 'speak with full knowledge of his pasts, and I must even piece out what he had\\n', 'told me with my own poor inventions while Charlie wrote of the ways of bank-\\n', 'clerks.\\n', '\\n', 'I got together and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result was not\\n', 'cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing that might not have\\n', \"been compiled at second-hand from other people's books--except, perhaps, the\\n\", 'story of the fight in the harbor. The adventures of a Viking bad been written\\n', 'many times before; the history of a Greek galley-slave was no new thing, and\\n', 'though I wrote both, who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my\\n', 'details? I might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence. The Lords of\\n', 'Life and Death were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted. They would allow\\n', 'nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men. Though I\\n', 'was convinced of this, yet I could not leave the tale alone. Exaltation\\n', 'followed reaction, not once, but twenty times in the next few weeks. My moods\\n', 'varied with the March sunlight and flying clouds. By night or in the beauty of\\n', 'a spring morning I perceived that I could write that tale and shift continents\\n', 'thereby. In the wet, windy afternoons, I saw that the tale might indeed be\\n', 'written, but would be nothing more than a faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted\\n', 'piece of Wardour Street work at the end. Then I blessed Charlie in many ways--\\n', 'though it was no fault of his. He seemed to be busy with prize competitions,\\n', 'and I saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and\\n', 'grew ripe to spring, and the buds swelled in their sheaths. He did not care to\\n', 'read or talk of what he had read, and there was a new ring of self-assertion\\n', 'in his voice. I hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met; but\\n', 'Charlie alluded to it on every occasion, always as a story from which money\\n', 'was to be made.\\n', '\\n', '\"I think I deserve twenty-five per cent., don\\'t I, at least,\" be said, with\\n', 'beautiful frankness. \"I supplied all the ideas, didn\\'t I?\"\\n', '\\n', 'This greediness for silver was a new side in his nature. I assumed that it had\\n', 'been developed in the City, where Charlie was picking up the curious nasal\\n', 'drawl of the underbred City man.\\n', '\\n', '\"When the thing\\'s done we\\'ll talk about it. I can\\'t make anything of it at\\n', 'present. Red-haired or black-haired hero are equally difficult.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals. \"I can\\'t understand what\\n', 'you find so difficult. It\\'s all as clean as mud to me,\" he replied. A jet of\\n', 'gas puffed out between the bars, took light and whistled softly. \"Suppose we\\n', \"take the red-haired hero's adventures first, from the time that he came south\\n\", 'to my galley and captured it and sailed to the Beaches.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I knew better now than to interrupt Charlie. I was out of reach of pen and\\n', 'paper, and dared not move to get them lest I should break the current. The\\n', \"gas-jet puffed and whinnied, Charlie's voice dropped almost to a whisper, and\\n\", 'he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to Furdurstrandi, of sunsets\\n', 'on the open sea, seen under the curve of the one sail evening after evening\\n', \"when the galley's beak was notched into the centre of the sinking disc, and\\n\", '\"we sailed by that for we had no other guide,\" quoth Charlie. He spoke of a\\n', 'landing on an island and explorations in its woods, where the crew killed\\n', 'three men whom they found asleep under the pines. Their ghosts, Charlie said,\\n', 'followed the galley, swimming and choking in the water, and the crew cast lots\\n', 'and threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods\\n', 'whom they had offended. Then they ate sea-weed when their provisions failed,\\n', 'and their legs swelled, and their leader, the red-haired man, killed two\\n', 'rowers who mutinied, and after a year spent among the woods they set sail for\\n', 'their own country, and a wind that never failed carried them back so safely\\n', 'that they all slept at night. This and much more Charlie told. Sometimes the\\n', 'voice fell so low that I could not catch the words, though every nerve was on\\n', 'the strain. He spoke of their leader, the red-haired man, as a pagan speaks of\\n', 'his God; for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he\\n', 'thought best for their needs; and it was he who steered them for three days\\n', 'among floating ice, each floe crowded with strange beasts that \"tried to sail\\n', 'with us,\" said Charlie, \"and we beat them back with the handles of the oars.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The gas-jet went out, a burned coal gave way, and the fire settled down with a\\n', 'tiny crash to the bottom of the grate. Charlie ceased speaking, and I said no\\n', 'word.\\n', '\\n', '\"By Jove!\" he said, at last, shaking his head. \"I\\'ve been staring at the fire\\n', 'till I\\'m dizzy. What was I going to say?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Something about the galley.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I remember now. It\\'s 25 per cent. of the profits, isn\\'t it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s anything you like when I\\'ve done the tale.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wanted to be sure of that. I must go now. I\\'ve, I\\'ve an appointment.\" And\\n', 'he left me.\\n', '\\n', 'Had my eyes not been held I might have known that that broken muttering over\\n', 'the fire was the swan-song of Charlie Mears.

He was nervous and\\n', 'embarrassed, but his eyes were very full of light, and his lips a little\\n', 'parted.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve done a poem,\" he said; and then quickly: \"it\\'s the best I\\'ve ever done.\\n', 'Read it.\" He thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window.\\n', '\\n', 'I groaned inwardly. It would be the work of half an hour to criticise--that is\\n', 'to say praise--the poem sufficiently to please Charlie. Then I had good reason\\n', 'to groan, for Charlie, discarding his favorite centipede metres, had launched\\n', 'into shorter and choppier verse, and verse with a motive at the back of it.\\n', 'This is what I read:\\n', '\\n', '\"The day is most fair, the cheery wind\\n', ' Halloos behind the hill,\\n', ' Where bends the wood as seemeth good,\\n', ' And the sapling to his will!\\n', ' Riot O wind; there is that in my blood\\n', ' That would not have thee still!\\n', '\\n', ' \"She gave me herself, O Earth, O Sky:\\n', ' Grey sea, she is mine alone--I\\n', ' Let the sullen boulders hear my cry,\\n', \" And rejoice tho' they be but stone!\\n\", '\\n', \" 'Mine!

Life was cheap, however. The soil spawned\\n', 'humanity, as it bred frogs in the Rains, and the gap of the sickness of one\\n', 'season was filled to overflowing by the fecundity of the next.

My husband says that\\n', 'I am free to elope with you. Get a dak for Thursday, and we will fly after\\n', 'dinner.\" There was a cold-bloodedness about that procedure which did not\\n', 'appeal to her. So she sat still in her own house and thought.\\n', '\\n', 'At dinner-time Boulte came back from his walk, white and worn and haggard, and\\n', 'the woman was touched at his distress. As the evening wore on, she muttered\\n', 'some expression of sorrow, something approaching to contrition. Boulte came\\n', 'out of a brown study and said, \"Oh, that! I wasn\\'t thinking about that. By the\\n', 'way, what does Kurrell say to the elopement?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I haven\\'t seen him,\" said Mrs. Boulte. \"Good God! is that all?\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Boulte was not listening, and her sentence ended in a gulp.\\n', '\\n', 'The next day brought no comfort to Mrs. Boulte, for Kurrell did not appear,\\n', \"and the new life that she, in the five minutes' madness of the previous\\n\", 'evening, had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old, seemed to be no\\n', 'nearer.\\n', '\\n', 'Boulte ate his breakfast, advised her to see her Arab pony fed in the veranda,\\n', 'and went out. The morning wore through, and at midday the tension became\\n', 'unendurable. Mrs. Boulte could not cry. She had finished her crying in the\\n', 'night, and now she did not want to be left alone. Perhaps the Vansuythen woman\\n', 'would talk to her; and, since talking opens the heart, perhaps there might be\\n', 'some comfort to be found in her company. She was the only other woman in the\\n', 'Station.\\n', '\\n', 'In Kashima there are no regular calling-hours. Every one can drop in upon\\n', 'every one else at pleasure. Mrs. Boulte put on a big terai hat, and walked\\n', \"across to the Vansuythens's house to borrow last week's Queen. The two\\n\", 'compounds touched, and instead of going up the drive, she crossed through the\\n', 'gap in the cactus-hedge, entering the house from the back. As she passed\\n', 'through the dining-room, she heard, behind the purdah that cloaked the\\n', 'drawing-room door, her husband\\'s voice, saying--\"But on my Honor! On my Soul\\n', \"and Honor, I tell you she doesn't care for me. She told me so last night. I\\n\", \"would have told you then if Vansuythen hadn't been with you. If it is for her\\n\", \"sake that you'll have nothing to say to me, you can make your mind easy. It's\\n\", \"Kurrell'\\n\", '\\n', '\"What?\" said Mrs. Vansuythen, with an hysterical little laugh. \"Kurrell! Oh,\\n', \"it can't be. You two must have made some horrible mistake. Perhaps you--you\\n\", \"lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't be as wrong as\\n\", 'you say.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the man's pleading, and was\\n\", 'desperately trying to keep him to a side-issue.\\n', '\\n', '\"There must be some mistake,\" she insisted, \"and it can be all put right\\n', 'again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Boulte laughed grimly.\\n', '\\n', '\"It can\\'t be Captain Kurrell!

He swore he had not,\" said Mrs. Vansuythen.\\n', '\\n', 'The purdah rustled, and the speech was cut short by the entry of a little,\\n', 'thin woman with big rings round her eyes. Mrs. Vansuythen stood up with a\\n', 'gasp.\\n', '\\n', '\"What was that you said?\" asked Mrs. Boulte. \"Never mind that man. What did\\n', 'Ted say to you? What did he say to you? What did he say to you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa, overborne by the trouble of\\n', 'her questioner.\\n', '\\n', '\"He said--I can\\'t remember exactly what he said--but I understood him to say--\\n', 'that is--But, really, Mrs. Boulte, isn\\'t it rather a strange question?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Will you tell me what he said?\" repeated Mrs. Boulte.\\n', '\\n', 'Even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps, and Mrs. Vansuythen\\n', 'was only an ordinarily good woman. She began in a sort of desperation: \"Well,\\n', 'he said that he never cared for you at all, and, of course, there was not the\\n', 'least reason why he should have, and--and--that was all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You said he swore he had not cared for me. Was that true?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Vansuythen, very softly.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Boulte wavered for an instant where she stood, and then fell forward\\n', 'fainting.\\n', '\\n', '\"What did I tell you?\" said Boulte, as though the conversation had been\\n', 'unbroken. \"You can see for yourself she cares for him.\" The light began to\\n', 'break into his dull mind, and he went on--\"And he--what was he saying to you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Mrs. Vansuythen, with no heart for explanations or impassioned\\n', 'protestations, was kneeling over Mrs. Boulte.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, you brute!\" she cried. \"Are all men like this? Help me to get her into my\\n', 'room--and her face is cut against the table. Oh, will you be quiet, and help\\n', 'me to carry her? I hate you, and I hate Captain Kurrell.

You\\'ve been a true friend to her too, haven\\'t you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Kurrell stared long and gravely. The situation was getting beyond him.\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you mean?\" he said.\\n', '\\n', \"Boulte answered, more to himself than the questioner: 'My wife came over to\\n\", \"Mrs. Vansuythen's just now; and it seems you'd been telling Mrs. Vansuythen\\n\", \"that you'd never cared for Emma. I suppose you lied, as usual. What had Mrs.\\n\", 'Vansuythen to do with you, or you with her?

What happened?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Emma fainted,\" said Boulte, simply. \"But, look here, what had you been saying\\n', 'to Mrs. Vansuythen?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Kurrell laughed.

By the way what about the political rights of\\n', 'these folk under your schemes? The country people call them vermin, but I\\n', 'suppose they would be electors with the rest.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nonsense--special provision would be made for them in a well-considered\\n', 'electoral scheme, and they would doubtless be treated with fitting severity,\"\\n', 'said Pagett, with a magisterial air.\\n', '\\n', '\"Severity, yes--but whether it would be fitting is doubtful.

Already we have a debating club in connection with the\\n', 'college, and elect a Mr. Speaker. Sir, the progress must come.

Norman Conquest, Magna Charta, Runnymede,\\n', 'Reformation, Tudors, Stuarts, Mr. Milton and Mr. Burke, and I have read\\n', \"something of Mr. Herbert Spencer and Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall,' Reynolds'\\n\", '\\'Mysteries of the Court,\\' and\"--\\n', '\\n', 'Pagett felt like one who had pulled the string of a shower-bath unawares, and\\n', 'hastened to stop the torrent with a question as to what particular grievances\\n', 'of the people of India the attention of an elected assembly should be first\\n', 'directed. But young Mr. Dma Nath was slow to particularize. There were many,\\n', 'very many demanding consideration. Mr. Pagett would like to hear of one or two\\n', 'typical examples. The Repeal of the Arms Act was at last named, and the\\n', 'student learned for the first time that a license was necessary before an\\n', 'Englishman could carry a gun in England. Then natives of India ought to be\\n', 'allowed to become Volunteer Riflemen if they chose, and the absolute equality\\n', 'of the Oriental with his European fellow-subject in civil status should be\\n', 'proclaimed on principle, and the Indian Army should be considerably reduced.\\n', \"The student was not, however, prepared with answers to Mr. Pagett's mildest\\n\", 'questions on these points, and he returned to vague generalities, leaving the\\n', 'M.P. so much impressed with the crudity of his views that he was glad on\\n', 'Orde\\'s return to say goodbye to his \"very interesting\" young friend.\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you think of young India?\" asked Orde.\\n', '\\n', '\"Curious, very curious--and callow.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And yet,\" the civilian replied, \"one can scarcely help sympathizing with him\\n', \"for his mere youth's sake. The young orators of the Oxford Union arrived at\\n\", 'the same conclusions and showed doubtless just the same enthusiasm. If there\\n', 'were any political analogy between India and England, if the thousand races of\\n', 'this Empire were one, if there were any chance even of their learning to speak\\n', 'one language, if, in short, India were a Utopia of the debating-room, and not\\n', 'a real land, this kind of talk might be worth listening to, but it is all\\n', 'based on false analogy and ignorance of the facts.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But he is a native and knows the facts.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He is a sort of English schoolboy, but married three years, and the father of\\n', 'two weaklings, and knows less than most English schoolboys. You saw all he is\\n', 'and knows, and such ideas as he has acquired are directly hostile to the most\\n', 'cherished convictions of the vast majority of the people.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college? Is he a\\n', 'Christian?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He meant just what he said, and he is not a Christian, nor ever will he be.\\n', 'Good people in America, Scotland and England, most of whom would never dream\\n', 'of collegiate education for their own sons, are pinching themselves to bestow\\n', 'it in pure waste on Indian youths. Their scheme is an oblique, subterranean\\n', 'attack on heathenism; the theory being that with the jam of secular education,\\n', 'leading to a University degree, the pill of moral or religious instruction may\\n', 'he coaxed down the heathen gullet.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But does it succeed; do they make converts?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They make no converts, for the subtle Oriental swallows the jam and rejects\\n', 'the pill; but the mere example of the sober, righteous, and godly lives of the\\n', 'principals and professors who are most excellent and devoted men, must have a\\n', 'certain moral value. Yet, as Lord Lansdowne pointed out the other day, the\\n', 'market is dangerously overstocked with graduates of our Universities who look\\n', 'for employment in the administration. An immense number are employed, but year\\n', 'by year the college mills grind out increasing lists of youths foredoomed to\\n', 'failure and disappointment, and meanwhile, trades, manufactures, and the\\n', 'industrial arts are neglected, and in fact regarded with contempt by our new\\n', 'literary mandarins in posse.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But our young friend said he wanted steam-engines and factories,\" said\\n', 'Pagett.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, he would like to direct such concerns. He wants to begin at the top, for\\n', 'manual labor is held to be discreditable, and he would never defile his hands\\n', 'by the apprenticeship which the architects, engineers, and manufacturers of\\n', 'England cheerfully undergo; and he would be aghast to learn that the leading\\n', 'names of industrial enterprise in England belonged a generation or two since,\\n', 'or now belong, to men who wrought with their own hands. And, though he talks\\n', 'glibly of manufacturers, he refuses to see that the Indian manufacturer of the\\n', 'future will be the despised workman of the present. It was proposed, for\\n', 'example, a few weeks ago, that a certain municipality in this province should\\n', 'establish an elementary technical school for the sons of workmen. The stress\\n', 'of the opposition to the plan came from a pleader who owed all he had to a\\n', 'college education bestowed on him gratis by Government and missions. You would\\n', 'have fancied some fine old crusted Tory squire of the last generation was\\n', \"speaking. 'These people,' he said, 'want no education, for they learn their\\n\", \"trades from their fathers, and to teach a workman's son the elements of\\n\", 'mathematics and physical science would give him ideas above his business. They\\n', 'must be kept in their place, and it was idle to imagine that there was any\\n', \"science in wood or iron work.' And he carried his point. But the Indian\\n\", 'workman will rise in the social scale in spite of the new literary caste.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In England we have scarcely begun to realize that there is an industrial\\n', 'class in this country, yet, I suppose, the example of men, like Edwards for\\n', 'instance, must tell,\" said Pagett, thoughtfully.\\n', '\\n', '\"That you shouldn\\'t know much about it is natural enough, for there are but\\n', 'few sources of information. India in this, as in other respects, is like a\\n', 'badly kept ledger--not written up to date. And men like Edwards are, in\\n', 'reality, missionaries, who by precept and example are teaching more lessons\\n', 'than they know. Only a few, however, of their crowds of subordinates seem to\\n', 'care to try to emulate them, and aim at individual advancement; the rest drop\\n', 'into the ancient Indian caste groove.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How do you mean?\" asked Pagett.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, it is found that the new railway and factory workmen, the fitter, the\\n', 'smith, the engine-driver, and the rest are already forming separate hereditary\\n', 'castes. You may notice this down at Jamalpur in Bengal, one of the oldest\\n', 'railway centres; and at other places, and in other industries, they are\\n', 'following the same inexorable Indian law.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Which means?\" queried Pagett.\\n', '\\n', '\"It means that the rooted habit of the people is to gather in small self-\\n', 'contained, self-sufficing family groups with no thought or care for any\\n', 'interests but their own--a habit which is scarcely compatible with the right\\n', 'acceptation of the elective principle.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yet you must admit, Orde, that though our young friend was not able to\\n', 'expound the faith that is in him, your Indian army is too big.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not nearly big enough for its main purpose. And, as a side issue, there are\\n', 'certain powerful minorities of fighting folk whose interests an Asiatic\\n', 'Government is bound to consider. Arms is as much a means of livelihood as\\n', 'civil employ under Government and law. And it would be a heavy strain on\\n', 'British bayonets to hold down Sikhs, Jats, Bilochis, Rohillas, Rajputs, Bhils,\\n', 'Dogras, Pathans, and Gurkhas to abide by the decisions of a numerical majority\\n', \"opposed to their interests. Leave the 'numerical majority' to itself without\\n\", 'the British bayonets--a flock of sheep might as reasonably hope to manage a\\n', 'troop of collies.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This complaint about excessive growth of the army is akin to another\\n', 'contention of the Congress party. They protest against the malversation of the\\n', 'whole of the moneys raised by additional taxes as a Famine Insurance Fund to\\n', 'other purposes. You must be aware that this special Famine Fund has all been\\n', 'spent on frontier roads and defences and strategic railway schemes as a\\n', 'protection against Russia.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But there was never a special famine fund raised by special taxation and put\\n', 'by as in a box. No sane administrator would dream of such a thing. In a time\\n', 'of prosperity a finance minister, rejoicing in a margin, proposed to annually\\n', 'apply a million and a half to the construction of railways and canals for the\\n', 'protection of districts liable to scarcity, and to the reduction of the annual\\n', 'loans for public works. But times were not always prosperous, and the finance\\n', 'minister had to choose whether be would bang up the insurance scheme for a\\n', \"year or impose fresh taxation. When a farmer hasn't got the little surplus he\\n\", 'hoped to have for buying a new wagon and draining a low-lying field corner,\\n', \"you don't accuse him of malversation, if he spends what he has on the\\n\", 'necessary work of the rest of his farm.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A clatter of hoofs was heard, and Orde looked up with vexation, but his brow\\n', 'cleared as a horseman halted under the porch.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hello, Orde! just looked in to ask if you are coming to polo on Tuesday: we\\n', 'want you badly to help to crumple up the Krab Bokhar team.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Orde explained that he had to go out into the District, and while the visitor\\n', \"complained that though good men wouldn't play, duffers were always keen, and\\n\", 'that his side would probably be beaten, Pagett rose to look at his mount, a\\n', 'red, lathered Biloch mare, with a curious lyrelike incurving of the ears.\\n', '\"Quite a little thoroughbred in all other respects,\" said the M.P., and Orde\\n', 'presented Mr. Reginald Burke, Manager of the Siad and Sialkote Bank to his\\n', 'friend.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, she\\'s as good as they make \\'em, and she\\'s all the female I possess and\\n', 'spoiled in consequence, aren\\'t you, old girl?\" said Burke, patting the mare\\'s\\n', 'glossy neck as she backed and plunged.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Pagett,\" said Orde, \"has been asking me about the Congress. What is your\\n', 'opinion?\" Burke turned to the M. P. with a frank smile.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, if it\\'s all the same to you, sir, I should say, Damn the Congress, but\\n', 'then I\\'m no politician, but only a business man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You find it a tiresome subject?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, it\\'s all that, and worse than that, for this kind of agitation is\\n', 'anything but wholesome for the country.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How do you mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It would be a long job to explain, and Sara here won\\'t stand, but you know\\n', 'how sensitive capital is, and how timid investors are.

The Indian Government is much too timid with its money--like an old\\n', \"maiden aunt of mine--always in a funk about her investments.

Better consult the merchants and chambers of\\n', 'commerce in Cawnpore, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. But though these bodies\\n', 'would like, as Reggie puts it, to make Government sit up, it is an elementary\\n', 'consideration in governing a country like India, which must be administered\\n', 'for the benefit of the people at large, that the counsels of those who resort\\n', 'to it for the sake of making money should be judiciously weighed and not\\n', 'allowed to overpower the rest. They are welcome guests here, as a matter of\\n', 'course, but it has been found best to restrain their influence. Thus the\\n', 'rights of plantation laborers, factory operatives, and the like, have been\\n', 'protected, and the capitalist, eager to get on, has not always regarded\\n', 'Government action with favor. It is quite conceivable that under an elective\\n', 'system the commercial communities of the great towns might find means to\\n', 'secure majorities on labor questions and on financial matters.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They would act at least with intelligence and consideration.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Intelligence, yes; but as to consideration, who at the present moment most\\n', 'bitterly resents the tender solicitude of Lancashire for the welfare and\\n', 'protection of the Indian factory operative? English and native capitalists\\n', 'running cotton mills and factories.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But is the solicitude of Lancashire in this matter entirely disinterested?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is no business of mine to say. I merely indicate an example of how a\\n', 'powerful commercial interest might hamper a Government intent in the first\\n', 'place on the larger interests of humanity.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Orde broke off to listen a moment. \"There\\'s Dr. Lathrop talking to my wife in\\n', 'the drawing-room,\" said he.\\n', '\\n', '\"Surely not; that\\'s a lady\\'s voice, and if my ears don\\'t deceive me, an\\n', 'American.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Exactly, Dr. Eva McCreery Lathrop, chief of the new Women\\'s Hospital here,\\n', 'and a very good fellow forbye.

One result\\n', 'is that girls of twelve and thirteen have to bear the burden of wifehood and\\n', 'motherhood, and, as might be expected, the rate of mortality both for mothers\\n', 'and children is terrible. Pauperism, domestic unhappiness, and a low state of\\n', 'health are only a few of the consequences of this. Then, when, as frequently\\n', 'happens, the boy-husband dies prematurely, his widow is condemned to worse\\n', 'than death.

Why, even of the funds devoted to the\\n', \"Marchioness of Dufferin's organization for medical aid to the women of India,\\n\", 'it was said in print and in speech, that they would be better spent on more\\n', \"college scholarships for men.

He\\n', 'desired no more mountaineering.\\n', '\\n', 'He made small haste to go away, and recovered his strength slowly.\\n', '\\n', 'Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife; so the\\n', \"latter spoke to the Englishman, and told him how matters stood in Lispeth's\\n\", 'heart. He laughed a good deal, and said it was very pretty and romantic, a\\n', 'perfect idyl of the Himalayas; but, as he was engaged to a girl at Home, he\\n', 'fancied that nothing would happen. Certainly he would behave with discretion.\\n', 'He did that. Still he found it very pleasant to talk to Lispeth, and walk with\\n', 'Lispeth, and say nice things to her, and call her pet names while he was\\n', 'getting strong enough to go away.

She was very happy while the fortnight\\n', 'lasted, because she had found a man to love.\\n', '\\n', 'Being a savage by birth, she took no trouble to hide her feelings, and the\\n', 'Englishman was amused.

She knew where\\n', 'England was, because she had read little geography primers; but, of course,\\n', 'she had no conception of the nature of the sea, being a Hill girl.\\n', '\\n', 'There was an old puzzle-map of the World in the House. Lispeth had played with\\n', 'it when she was a child. She unearthed it again, and put it together of\\n', 'evenings, and cried to herself, and tried to imagine where her Englishman was.\\n', 'As she had no ideas of distance or steamboats, her notions were somewhat\\n', 'erroneous. It would not have made the least difference had she been perfectly\\n', 'correct; for the Englishman had no intention of coming back to marry a Hill\\n', 'girl. He forgot all about her by the time he was butterfly-hunting in Assam.\\n', \"He wrote a book on the East afterwards.

Lispeth said that all this was clearly\\n', \"impossible, because he had said he loved her, and the Chaplain's wife had,\\n\", 'with her own lips, asserted that the Englishman was coming back.\\n', '\\n', '\"How can what he and you said be untrue?\" asked Lispeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet, child,\" said the Chaplain\\'s wife.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then you have lied to me,\" said Lispeth, \"you and he?\"\\n', '\\n', \"The Chaplain's wife bowed her head, and said nothing.

He was pretty and was petted. He took the pettings seriously, and\\n', 'fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call upon. He found his new\\n', 'free life in India very good.\\n', '\\n', \"It DOES look attractive in the beginning, from a Subaltern's point of view--\\n\", 'all ponies, partners, dancing, and so on. He tasted it as the puppy tastes the\\n', 'soap. Only he came late to the eating, with a growing set of teeth. He had no\\n', 'sense of balance--just like the puppy--and could not understand why he was not\\n', \"treated with the consideration he received under his father's roof. This hurt\\n\", 'his feelings.\\n', '\\n', 'He quarrelled with other boys, and, being sensitive to the marrow, remembered\\n', 'these quarrels, and they excited him. He found whist, and gymkhanas, and\\n', 'things of that kind (meant to amuse one after office) good; but he took them\\n', 'seriously too, just as he took the \"head\" that followed after drink. He lost\\n', 'his money over whist and gymkhanas because they were new to him.\\n', '\\n', 'He took his losses seriously, and wasted as much energy and interest over a\\n', 'two-gold-mohur race for maiden ekka-ponies with their manes hogged, as if it\\n', 'had been the Derby. One-half of this came from inexperience--much as the puppy\\n', 'squabbles with the corner of the hearth-rug--and the other half from the\\n', 'dizziness bred by stumbling out of his quiet life into the glare and\\n', 'excitement of a livelier one. No one told him about the soap and the blacking\\n', 'because an average man takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily\\n', 'careful in regard to them. It was pitiful to watch The Boy knocking himself to\\n', 'pieces, as an over-handled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away\\n', 'from the groom.\\n', '\\n', 'This unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking line\\n', 'for, much less rioting over, endured for six months--all through one cold\\n', 'weather--and then we thought that the heat and the knowledge of having lost\\n', 'his money and health and lamed his horses would sober The Boy down, and he\\n', 'would stand steady. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred this would have\\n', 'happened. You can see the principle working in any Indian Station. But this\\n', 'particular case fell through because The Boy was sensitive and took things\\n', \"seriously--as I may have said some seven times before. Of course, we couldn't\\n\", 'tell how his excesses struck him personally.\\n', '\\n', 'They were nothing very heart-breaking or above the average. He might be\\n', 'crippled for life financially, and want a little nursing.\\n', '\\n', 'Still the memory of his performances would wither away in one hot weather, and\\n', 'the shroff would help him to tide over the money troubles. But he must have\\n', 'taken another view altogether and have believed himself ruined beyond\\n', 'redemption. His Colonel talked to him severely when the cold weather ended.\\n', 'That made him more wretched than ever; and it was only an ordinary \"Colonel\\'s\\n', 'wigging!\"\\n', '\\n', 'What follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all linked\\n', 'together and made responsible for one another. THE thing that kicked the beam\\n', \"in The Boy's mind was a remark that a woman made when he was talking to her.\\n\", 'There is no use in repeating it, for it was only a cruel little sentence,\\n', 'rapped out before thinking, that made him flush to the roots of his hair. He\\n', \"kept himself to himself for three days, and then put in for two days' leave to\\n\", \"go shooting near a Canal Engineer's Rest House about thirty miles out. He got\\n\", 'his leave, and that night at Mess was noisier and more offensive than ever. He\\n', 'said that he was \"going to shoot big game, and left at half-past ten o\\'clock\\n', 'in an ekka.\\n', '\\n', 'Partridge--which was the only thing a man could get near the Rest House--is\\n', 'not big game; so every one laughed.\\n', '\\n', 'Next morning one of the Majors came in from short leave, and heard that The\\n', 'Boy had gone out to shoot \"big game.\" The Major had taken an interest in The\\n', 'Boy, and had, more than once, tried to check him in the cold weather. The\\n', 'Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the expedition and went to The\\n', \"Boy's room, where he rummaged.\\n\", '\\n', 'Presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the Mess.\\n', '\\n', 'There was no one else in the ante-room.\\n', '\\n', 'He said: \"The Boy has gone out shooting. DOES a man shoot\\n', '\\n', '@tetur with a revolver and a writing-case?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I said: \"Nonsense, Major!\" for I saw what was in his mind.\\n', '\\n', 'He said: \"Nonsense or nonsense, I\\'m going to the Canal now--at once. I don\\'t\\n', 'feel easy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then he thought for a minute, and said: \"Can you lie?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You know best,\" I answered. \"It\\'s my profession.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well,\" said the Major; \"you must come out with me now--at once--in an\\n', 'ekka to the Canal to shoot black-buck. Go and put on shikar-kit--quick--and\\n', 'drive here with a gun.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Major was a masterful man; and I knew that he would not give orders for\\n', 'nothing. So I obeyed, and on return found the Major packed up in an ekka--gun-\\n', 'cases and food slung below--all ready for a shooting-trip.\\n', '\\n', 'He dismissed the driver and drove himself. We jogged along quietly while in\\n', 'the station; but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the plains, he\\n', 'made that pony fly. A country-bred can do nearly anything at a pinch. We\\n', 'covered the thirty miles in under three hours, but the poor brute was nearly\\n', 'dead.\\n', '\\n', 'Once I said: \"What\\'s the blazing hurry, Major?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He said, quietly: \"The Boy has been alone, by himself, for--one, two, five--\\n', 'fourteen hours now! I tell you, I don\\'t feel easy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This uneasiness spread itself to me, and I helped to beat the pony.\\n', '\\n', \"When we came to the Canal Engineer's Rest House the Major called for The Boy's\\n\", 'servant; but there was no answer. Then we went up to the house, calling for\\n', 'The Boy by name; but there was no answer.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, he\\'s out shooting,\" said I.\\n', '\\n', 'Just then I saw through one of the windows a little hurricane-lamp burning.\\n', 'This was at four in the afternoon. We both stopped dead in the verandah,\\n', 'holding our breath to catch every sound; and we heard, inside the room, the\\n', '\"brr--brr--brr\" of a multitude of flies. The Major said nothing, but he took\\n', 'off his helmet and we entered very softly.\\n', '\\n', 'The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare, lime- washed room.\\n', 'He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver. The gun-cases were\\n', \"still strapped, so was the bedding, and on the table lay The Boy's writing-\\n\", 'case with photographs. He had gone away to die like a poisoned rat!\\n', '\\n', 'The Major said to himself softly: \"Poor Boy! Poor, POOR devil!\" Then he turned\\n', 'away from the bed and said: \"I want your help in this business.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand, I saw exactly what that help would\\n', 'be, so I passed over to the table, took a chair, lit a cheroot, and began to\\n', 'go through the writing-case; the Major looking over my shoulder and repeating\\n', 'to himself: \"We came too late!--Like a rat in a hole!--Poor, POOR devil!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people, and to his\\n', 'Colonel, and to a girl at Home; and as soon as he had finished, must have shot\\n', 'himself, for he had been dead a long time when we came in.\\n', '\\n', 'I read all that he had written, and passed over each sheet to the Major as I\\n', 'finished it.\\n', '\\n', 'We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything. He wrote\\n', 'about \"disgrace which he was unable to bear\"--\"indelible shame\"--\"criminal\\n', 'folly\"--\"wasted life,\" and so on; besides a lot of private things to his\\n', 'Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into print. The letter to the\\n', 'girl at Home was the most pitiful of all; and I choked as I read it. The Major\\n', 'made no attempt to keep dry-eyed. I respected him for that. He read and rocked\\n', 'himself to and fro, and simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it.\\n', 'The letters were so dreary and hopeless and touching. We forgot all about The\\n', \"Boy's follies, and only thought of the poor Thing on the charpoy and the\\n\", 'scrawled sheets in our hands. It was utterly impossible to let the letters go\\n', 'Home.\\n', '\\n', \"They would have broken his Father's heart and killed his Mother after killing\\n\", 'her belief in her son.\\n', '\\n', 'At last the Major dried his eyes openly, and said: \"Nice sort of thing to\\n', 'spring on an English family! What shall we do?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I said, knowing what the Major had brought me but for: \"The Boy died of\\n', \"cholera. We were with him at the time. We can't commit ourselves to half-\\n\", 'measures. Come along.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part in--the\\n', \"concoction of a big, written lie, bolstered with evidence, to soothe The Boy's\\n\", 'people at Home. I began the rough draft of a letter, the Major throwing in\\n', 'hints here and there while he gathered up all the stuff that The Boy had\\n', 'written and burnt it in the fireplace. It was a hot, still evening when we\\n', 'began, and the lamp burned very badly. In due course I got the draft to my\\n', 'satisfaction, setting forth how The Boy was the pattern of all virtues,\\n', 'beloved by his regiment, with every promise of a great career before him, and\\n', 'so on; how we had helped him through the sickness--it was no time for little\\n', 'lies, you will understand--and how he had died without pain. I choked while I\\n', 'was putting down these things and thinking of the poor people who would read\\n', 'them.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair, and the laughter mixed\\n', 'itself up with the choke--and the Major said that we both wanted drinks.\\n', '\\n', 'I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was finished.\\n', \"It had not the least effect on us. Then we took off The Boy's watch, locket,\\n\", 'and rings.\\n', '\\n', 'Lastly, the Major said: \"We must send a lock of hair too. A woman values\\n', 'that.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send.\\n', '\\n', 'The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily. I cut off a piece of\\n', \"the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we\\n\", 'were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and I had\\n', 'to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and we both knew that the worst part of\\n', 'the work was to come.\\n', '\\n', 'We sealed up the packet, photographs, locket, seals, ring, letter, and lock of\\n', \"hair with The Boy's sealing-wax and The Boy's seal.\\n\", '\\n', 'Then the Major said: \"For God\\'s sake let\\'s get outside--away from the room--\\n', 'and think!\"\\n', '\\n', 'We went outside, and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour, eating and\\n', 'drinking what we had with us, until the moon rose. I know now exactly how a\\n', 'murderer feels. Finally, we forced ourselves back to the room with the lamp\\n', 'and the Other Thing in it, and began to take up the next piece of work. I am\\n', 'not going to write about this. It was too horrible. We burned the bedstead and\\n', 'dropped the ashes into the Canal; we took up the matting of the room and\\n', 'treated that in the same way. I went off to a village and borrowed two big\\n', 'hoes--I did not want the villagers to help--while the Major arranged--the\\n', \"other matters. It took us four hours' hard work to make the grave. As we\\n\", 'worked, we argued out whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of\\n', 'the Burial of the Dead.\\n', '\\n', \"We compromised things by saying the Lord's Prayer with a private unofficial\\n\", 'prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy. Then we filled in the grave and\\n', 'went into the verandah--not the house--to lie down to sleep. We were dead-\\n', 'tired.\\n', '\\n', 'When we woke the Major said, wearily: \"We can\\'t go back till tomorrow. We must\\n', 'give him a decent time to die in. He died early THIS morning, remember. That\\n', 'seems more natural.\" So the Major must have been lying awake all the time,\\n', 'thinking.\\n', '\\n', 'I said: \"Then why didn\\'t we bring the body back to the cantonments?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Major thought for a minute:--\"Because the people bolted when they heard of\\n', 'the cholera. And the ekka has gone!\"\\n', '\\n', 'That was strictly true. We had forgotten all about the ekka-pony, and he had\\n', 'gone home.\\n', '\\n', 'So, we were left there alone, all that stifling day, in the Canal Rest House,\\n', \"testing and re-testing our story of The Boy's death to see if it was weak at\\n\", 'any point. A native turned up in the afternoon, but we said that a Sahib was\\n', 'dead of cholera, and he ran away. As the dusk gathered, the Major told me all\\n', 'his fears about The Boy, and awful stories of suicide or nearly-carried-out\\n', \"suicide--tales that made one's hair crisp. He said that he himself had once\\n\", 'gone into the same Valley of the Shadow as the Boy, when he was young and new\\n', \"to the country; so he understood how things fought together in The Boy's poor\\n\", 'jumbled head. He also said that youngsters, in their repentant moments,\\n', 'consider their sins much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are.\\n', 'We talked together all through the evening, and rehearsed the story of the\\n', 'death of The Boy. As soon as the moon was up, and The Boy, theoretically, just\\n', 'buried, we struck across country for the Station. We walked from eight till\\n', \"six o'clock in the morning; but though we were dead-tired, we did not forget\\n\", \"to go to The Boy's room and put away his revolver with the proper amount of\\n\", 'cartridges in the pouch. Also to set his writing-case on the table. We found\\n', 'the Colonel and reported the death, feeling more like murderers than ever.\\n', 'Then we went to bed and slept the clock round; for there was no more in us.\\n', '\\n', 'The tale had credence as long as was necessary, for every one forgot about The\\n', 'Boy before a fortnight was over. Many people, however, found time to say that\\n', 'the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in the body for a\\n', \"regimental funeral. The saddest thing of all was a letter from The Boy's\\n\", 'mother to the Major and me--with big inky blisters all over the sheet. She\\n', 'wrote the sweetest possible things about our great kindness, and the\\n', 'obligation she would be under to us as long as she lived.\\n', '\\n', 'All things considered, she WAS under an obligation; but not exactly as she\\n', 'meant.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.\\n\", '\\n', 'When Man and Woman are agreed, what can the Kazi do?\\n', '      --Mahomedan Proverb.\\n', '\\n', 'Some people say that there is no romance in India. Those people are wrong. Our\\n', 'lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us.\\n', '\\n', 'Sometimes more.\\n', '\\n', 'Strickland was in the Police, and people did not understand him; so they said\\n', 'he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side. Strickland had\\n', 'himself to thank for this. He held the extraordinary theory that a Policeman\\n', 'in India should try to know as much about the natives as the natives\\n', 'themselves. Now, in the whole of Upper India, there is only ONE man who can\\n', 'pass for Hindu or Mohammedan, chamar or faquir, as he pleases. He is feared\\n', 'and respected by the natives from the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid; and he\\n', 'is supposed to have the gift of invisibility and executive control over many\\n', 'Devils. But what good has this done him with the Government? None in the\\n', 'world. He has never got Simla for his charge; and his name is almost unknown\\n', 'to Englishmen.\\n', '\\n', 'Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model; and, following\\n', 'out his absurd theory, dabbled in unsavory places no respectable man would\\n', 'think of exploring--all among the native riff-raff. He educated himself in\\n', 'this peculiar way for seven years, and people could not appreciate it. He was\\n', 'perpetually \"going Fantee\" among the natives, which, of course, no man with\\n', 'any sense believes in. He was initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once,\\n', 'when he was on leave; he knew the Lizard-Song of the Sansis, and the Halli-\\n', 'Hukk dance, which is a religious can-can of a startling kind. When a man knows\\n', 'who dances the Halli-Hukk, and how, and when, and where, he knows something to\\n', 'be proud of. He has gone deeper than the skin. But Strickland was not proud,\\n', 'though he had helped once, at Jagadhri, at the Painting of the Death Bull,\\n', \"which no Englishman must even look upon; had mastered the thieves'-patter of\\n\", 'the changars; had taken a Eusufzai horse-thief alone near Attock; and had\\n', 'stood under the mimbar-board of a Border mosque and conducted service in the\\n', 'manner of a Sunni Mollah.\\n', '\\n', 'His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the gardens\\n', 'of Baba Atal at Amritsar, and there picking up the threads of the great\\n', 'Nasiban Murder Case. But people said, justly enough: \"Why on earth can\\'t\\n', 'Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary, and recruit, and keep\\n', 'quiet, instead of showing up the incapacity of his seniors?\" So the Nasiban\\n', 'Murder Case did him no good departmentally; but, after his first feeling of\\n', 'wrath, he returned to his outlandish custom of prying into native life. By the\\n', 'way, when a man once acquires a taste for this particular amusement, it abides\\n', 'with him all his days. It is the most fascinating thing in the world; Love not\\n', 'excepted. Where other men took ten days to the Hills, Strickland took leave\\n', 'for what he called shikar, put on the disguise that appealed to him at the\\n', 'time, stepped down into the brown crowd, and was swallowed up for a while. He\\n', 'was a quiet, dark young fellow--spare, black-eyes--and, when he was not\\n', 'thinking of something else, a very interesting companion. Strickland on Native\\n', 'Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing. Natives hated Strickland; but\\n', 'they were afraid of him. He knew too much.\\n', '\\n', 'When the Youghals came into the station, Strickland--very gravely, as he did\\n', 'everything--fell in love with Miss Youghal; and she, after a while, fell in\\n', 'love with him because she could not understand him. Then Strickland told the\\n', 'parents; but Mrs. Youghal said she was not going to throw her daughter into\\n', 'the worst paid Department in the Empire, and old Youghal said, in so many\\n', \"words, that he mistrusted Strickland's ways and works, and would thank him not\\n\", 'to speak or write to his daughter any more. \"Very well,\" said Strickland, for\\n', \"he did not wish to make his lady-love's life a burden. After one long talk\\n\", 'with Miss Youghal he dropped the business entirely.\\n', '\\n', 'The Youghals went up to Simla in April.\\n', '\\n', 'In July, Strickland secured three months\\' leave on \"urgent private affairs.\"\\n', 'He locked up his house--though not a native in the Providence would wittingly\\n', 'have touched \"Estreekin Sahib\\'s\" gear for the world--and went down to see a\\n', 'friend of his, an old dyer, at Tarn Taran.\\n', '\\n', 'Here all trace of him was lost, until a sais met me on the Simla Mall with\\n', 'this extraordinary note:\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear old man,\\n', '\\n', 'Please give bearer a box of cheroots--Supers, No. I, for preference.

Quite apart from the little fact that the\\n', 'wife of one of his fellow-saises fell in love with him and then tried to\\n', 'poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing to do with her, he had\\n', 'to school himself into keeping quiet when Miss Youghal went out riding with\\n', 'some man who tried to flirt with her, and he was forced to trot behind\\n', 'carrying the blanket and hearing every word! Also, he had to keep his temper\\n', 'when he was slanged in \"Benmore\" porch by a policeman--especially once when he\\n', 'was abused by a Naik he had himself recruited from Isser Jang village--or,\\n', 'worse still, when a young subaltern called him a pig for not making way\\n', 'quickly enough.\\n', '\\n', 'But the life had its compensations. He obtained great insight into the ways\\n', 'and thefts of saises--enough, he says, to have summarily convicted half the\\n', 'chamar population of the Punjab if he had been on business. He became one of\\n', 'the leading players at knuckle-bones, which all jhampanis and many saises play\\n', 'while they are waiting outside the Government House or the Gaiety Theatre of\\n', 'nights; he learned to smoke tobacco that was three-fourths cowdung; and he\\n', 'heard the wisdom of the grizzled Jemadar of the Government House saises, whose\\n', 'words are valuable. He saw many things which amused him; and he states, on\\n', 'honor, that no man can appreciate Simla properly, till he has seen it from the\\n', \"sais's point of view.\\n\", '\\n', 'He also says that, if he chose to write all he saw, his head would be broken\\n', 'in several places.\\n', '\\n', \"Strickland's account of the agony he endured on wet nights, hearing the music\\n\", 'and seeing the lights in \"Benmore,\" with his toes tingling for a waltz and his\\n', 'head in a horse-blanket, is rather amusing.

Then he complimented Miss\\n', 'Youghal on her lover.\\n', '\\n', 'The scandal of the business never struck him; for he was a nice old man, with\\n', 'a weakness for flirtations.

They\\n', 'said:--\"God bless you, dear boy! Let us never see your face again,\"--or at\\n', 'least that was what Phil was given to understand.\\n', '\\n', 'When he sailed, he was very full of a great plan to prove himself several\\n', 'hundred times better than any one had given him credit for--to work like a\\n', 'horse, and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter. He had many good points besides\\n', 'his good looks; his only fault being that he was weak, the least little bit in\\n', 'the world weak. He had as much notion of economy as the Morning Sun; and yet\\n', 'you could not lay your hand on any one item, and say: \"Herein Phil Garron is\\n', 'extravagant or reckless.\" Nor could you point out any particular vice in his\\n', 'character; but he was \"unsatisfactory\" and as workable as putty.\\n', '\\n', 'Agnes Laiter went about her duties at home--her family objected to the\\n', 'engagement--with red eyes, while Phil was sailing to Darjiling--\"a port on the\\n', 'Bengal Ocean,\" as his mother used to tell her friends. He was popular enough\\n', 'on board ship, made many acquaintances and a moderately large liquor bill, and\\n', 'sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each port. Then he fell to work on\\n', 'this plantation, somewhere between Darjiling and Kangra, and, though the\\n', 'salary and the horse and the work were not quite all he had fancied, he\\n', 'succeeded fairly well, and gave himself much unnecessary credit for his\\n', 'perseverance.\\n', '\\n', 'In the course of time, as he settled more into collar, and his work grew fixed\\n', 'before him, the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only came when\\n', 'he was at leisure, which was not often.

Only,\\n', 'another man--a really desirable young man--presented himself before Mrs.\\n', 'Laiter; and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as far off as ever; and his\\n', 'letters were so unsatisfactory; and there was a certain amount of domestic\\n', 'pressure brought to bear on the girl; and the young man really was an eligible\\n', 'person as incomes go; and the end of all things was that Agnes married him,\\n', 'and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind of a letter to Phil in the wilds of\\n', 'Darjiling, and said she should never know a happy moment all the rest of her\\n', 'life. Which was a true prophecy.\\n', '\\n', 'Phil got that letter, and held himself ill-treated. This was two years after\\n', 'he had come out; but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter, and looking\\n', 'at her photograph, and patting himself on the back for being one of the most\\n', 'constant lovers in history, and warming to the work as he went on, he really\\n', 'fancied that he had been very hardly used. He sat down and wrote one final\\n', 'letter--a really pathetic \"world without end, amen,\" epistle; explaining how\\n', 'he would be true to Eternity, and that all women were very much alike, and he\\n', 'would hide his broken heart, etc., etc.; but if, at any future time, etc.,\\n', 'etc., he could afford to wait, etc., etc., unchanged affections, etc., etc.,\\n', 'return to her old love, etc., etc., for eight closely-written pages. From an\\n', 'artistic point of view, it was very neat work, but an ordinary Philistine, who\\n', \"knew the state of Phil's real feelings--not the ones he rose to as he went on\\n\", 'writing--would have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish work of a\\n', 'thoroughly mean and selfish, weak man.

Which is\\n', 'the first duty of every Christian maid.\\n', '\\n', 'Phil went his ways, and thought no more of his letter, except as an artist\\n', 'thinks of a neatly touched-in sketch. His ways were not bad, but they were not\\n', 'altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya, the daughter of a\\n', 'Rajput ex-Subadar-Major of our Native Army.

She was a good girl and\\n', 'handsome, and, in her way, very clever and shrewd; though, of course, a little\\n', 'hard. It is to be remembered that Phil was living very comfortably, denying\\n', 'himself no small luxury, never putting by an anna, very satisfied with himself\\n', 'and his good intentions, was dropping all his English correspondents one by\\n', 'one, and beginning more and more to look upon this land as his home. Some men\\n', 'fall this way; and they are of no use afterwards. The climate where he was\\n', 'stationed was good, and it really did not seem to him that there was anything\\n', 'to go Home for.\\n', '\\n', 'He did what many planters have done before him--that is to say, he made up his\\n', 'mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down. He was seven and twenty then, with\\n', 'a long life before him, but no spirit to go through with it. So he married\\n', 'Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church, and some fellow-planters said he\\n', 'was a fool, and some said he was a wise man. Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest\\n', 'girl, and, in spite of her reverence for an Englishman, had a reasonable\\n', \"estimate of her husband's weaknesses.

Three years after\\n', 'he was married--and after he had tried Nice and Algeria for his complaint--he\\n', 'went to Bombay, where he died, and set Agnes free. Being a devout woman, she\\n', 'looked on his death and the place of it, as a direct interposition of\\n', 'Providence, and when she had recovered from the shock, she took out and reread\\n', 'Phil\\'s letter with the \"etc., etc.,\" and the big dashes, and the little\\n', 'dashes, and kissed it several times.

She sat for two\\n', \"months, alone in Watson's Hotel, elaborating this decision, and the picture\\n\", 'was a pretty one.

Saumarez was a strange man, with few merits, so far as men could\\n', 'see, though he was popular with women, and carried enough conceit to stock a\\n', \"Viceroy's Council and leave a little over for the Commander-in-Chief's Staff.\\n\", 'He was a Civilian. Very many women took an interest in Saumarez, perhaps,\\n', 'because his manner to them was offensive. If you hit a pony over the nose at\\n', 'the outset of your acquaintance, he may not love you, but he will take a deep\\n', 'interest in your movements ever afterwards. The elder Miss Copleigh was nice,\\n', 'plump, winning and pretty. The younger was not so pretty, and, from men\\n', 'disregarding the hint set forth above, her style was repellant and\\n', 'unattractive. Both girls had, practically, the same figure, and there was a\\n', 'strong likeness between them in look and voice; though no one could doubt for\\n', 'an instant which was the nicer of the two.\\n', '\\n', 'Saumarez made up his mind, as soon as they came into the station from Behar,\\n', 'to marry the elder one. At least, we all made sure that he would, which comes\\n', 'to the same thing. She was two and twenty, and he was thirty-three, with pay\\n', 'and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees a month. So the match, as we\\n', 'arranged it, was in every way a good one. Saumarez was his name, and summary\\n', 'was his nature, as a man once said. Having drafted his Resolution, he formed a\\n', 'Select Committee of One to sit upon it, and resolved to take his time. In our\\n', 'unpleasant slang, the Copleigh girls \"hunted in couples.\" That is to say, you\\n', 'could do nothing with one without the other. They were very loving sisters;\\n', 'but their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient. Saumarez held the\\n', 'balance-hair true between them, and none but himself could have said to which\\n', 'side his heart inclined; though every one guessed. He rode with them a good\\n', 'deal and danced with them, but he never succeeded in detaching them from each\\n', 'other for any length of time.\\n', '\\n', 'Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust, each\\n', 'fearing that the other would steal a march on her. But that has nothing to do\\n', 'with a man. Saumarez was silent for good or bad, and as\\n', '\\n', '@business--likely attentive as he could be, having due regard to his work and\\n', 'his polo. Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him.\\n', '\\n', 'As the hot weather drew nearer, and Saumarez made no sign, women said that you\\n', 'could see their trouble in the eyes of the girls--that they were looking\\n', 'strained, anxious, and irritable. Men are quite blind in these matters unless\\n', 'they have more of the woman than the man in their composition, in which case\\n', 'it does not matter what they say or think. I maintain it was the hot April\\n', \"days that took the color out of the Copleigh girls' cheeks. They should have\\n\", 'been sent to the Hills early. No one--man or woman--feels an angel when the\\n', 'hot weather is approaching. The younger sister grew more cynical--not to say\\n', 'acid--in her ways; and the winningness of the elder wore thin. There was more\\n', 'effort in it.\\n', '\\n', 'Now the Station wherein all these things happened was, though not a little\\n', 'one, off the line of rail, and suffered through want of attention. There were\\n', \"no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking of, and it was nearly a day's\\n\", 'journey to come into Lahore for a dance. People were grateful for small things\\n', 'to interest them.\\n', '\\n', 'About the beginning of May, and just before the final exodus of Hill-goers,\\n', 'when the weather was very hot and there were not more than twenty people in\\n', 'the Station, Saumarez gave a moonlight riding-picnic at an old tomb, six miles\\n', 'away, near the bed of the river. It was a \"Noah\\'s Ark\" picnic; and there was\\n', 'to be the usual arrangement of quarter-mile intervals between each couple, on\\n', 'account of the dust. Six couples came altogether, including chaperons.\\n', 'Moonlight picnics are useful just at the very end of the season, before all\\n', 'the girls go away to the Hills. They lead to understandings, and should be\\n', 'encouraged by chaperones; especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding\\n', 'habits. I knew a case once. But that is another story. That picnic was called\\n', 'the \"Great Pop Picnic,\" because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to\\n', 'the eldest Miss Copleigh; and, beside his affair, there was another which\\n', 'might possibly come to happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'The social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing.\\n', '\\n', 'We met at the parade-ground at ten: the night was fearfully hot.\\n', '\\n', 'The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but anything was better than sitting\\n', 'still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full moon we were\\n', 'four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls, and\\n', 'I loitered at the tail of the procession, wondering with whom Saumarez would\\n', 'ride home. Every one was happy and contented; but we all felt that things were\\n', 'going to happen. We rode slowly: and it was nearly midnight before we reached\\n', 'the old tomb, facing the ruined tank, in the decayed gardens where we were\\n', 'going to eat and drink. I was late in coming up; and before I went into the\\n', 'garden, I saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint, dun-colored\\n', 'feather. But no one would have thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an\\n', 'entertainment as this picnic--and a dust-storm, more or less, does no great\\n', 'harm.\\n', '\\n', 'We gathered by the tank. Some one had brought out a banjo--which is a most\\n', 'sentimental instrument--and three or four of us sang.\\n', '\\n', 'You must not laugh at this. Our amusements in out-of-the-way Stations are very\\n', 'few indeed. Then we talked in groups or together, lying under the trees, with\\n', 'the sun-baked roses dropping their petals on our feet, until supper was ready.\\n', 'It was a beautiful supper, as cold and as iced as you could wish; and we\\n', 'stayed long over it.\\n', '\\n', 'I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter; but nobody seemed to\\n', 'notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began lashing the\\n', 'orange-trees with a sound like the noise of the sea. Before we knew where we\\n', 'were, the dust-storm was on us, and everything was roaring, whirling darkness.\\n', 'The supper-table was blown bodily into the tank. We were afraid of staying\\n', 'anywhere near the old tomb for fear it might be blown down. So we felt our way\\n', 'to the orange-trees where the horses were picketed and waited for the storm to\\n', 'blow over. Then the little light that was left vanished, and you could not see\\n', 'your hand before your face. The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed\\n', 'of the river, that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and coated\\n', 'eyebrows and moustaches. It was one of the worst dust-storms of the year.\\n', '\\n', 'We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses, with the thunder\\n', 'clattering overhead, and the lightning spurting like water from a sluice, all\\n', 'ways at once. There was no danger, of course, unless the horses broke loose. I\\n', 'was standing with my head downward and my hands over my mouth, hearing the\\n', 'trees thrashing each other. I could not see who was next me till the flashes\\n', 'came.\\n', '\\n', 'Then I found that I was packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss Copleigh,\\n', 'with my own horse just in front of me. I recognized the eldest Miss Copleigh,\\n', 'because she had a pagri round her helmet, and the younger had not. All the\\n', 'electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was quivering and tingling\\n', 'from head to foot--exactly as a corn shoots and tingles before rain. It was a\\n', 'grand storm.\\n', '\\n', 'The wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in great\\n', 'heaps; and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the Day of\\n', 'Judgment.\\n', '\\n', 'The storm lulled slightly after the first half-hour, and I heard a despairing\\n', 'little voice close to my ear, saying to itself, quietly and softly, as if some\\n', 'lost soul were flying about with the wind: \"O my God!\" Then the younger Miss\\n', 'Copleigh stumbled into my arms, saying: \"Where is my horse? Get my horse. I\\n', 'want to go home. I WANT to go home. Take me home.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her; so I\\n', 'said there was no danger, but she must wait till the storm blew over. She\\n', 'answered: \"It is not THAT! It is not THAT! I want to go home! O take me away\\n', 'from here!\"\\n', '\\n', 'I said that she could not go till the light came; but I felt her brush past me\\n', 'and go away. It was too dark to see where. Then the whole sky was split open\\n', 'with one tremendous flash, as if the end of the world were coming, and all the\\n', 'women shrieked.\\n', '\\n', \"Almost directly after this, I felt a man's hand on my shoulder and heard\\n\", 'Saumarez bellowing in my ear. Through the rattling of the trees and howling of\\n', 'the wind, I did not catch his words at once, but at last I heard him say:\\n', '\"I\\'ve proposed to the wrong one! What shall I do?\" Saumarez had no occasion to\\n', 'make this confidence to me. I was never a friend of his, nor am I now; but I\\n', 'fancy neither of us were ourselves just then. He was shaking as he stood with\\n', 'excitement, and I was feeling queer all over with the electricity.\\n', '\\n', 'I could not think of anything to say except:--\"More fool you for proposing in\\n', 'a dust-storm.\" But I did not see how that would improve the mistake.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he shouted: \"Where\\'s Edith--Edith Copleigh?\" Edith was the youngest\\n', 'sister. I answered out of my astonishment:--\"What do you want with HER?\" Would\\n', 'you believe it, for the next two minutes, he and I were shouting at each other\\n', 'like maniacs--he vowing that it was the youngest sister he had meant to\\n', 'propose to all along, and I telling him till my throat was hoarse that he must\\n', \"have made a mistake! I can't account for this except, again, by the fact that\\n\", 'we were neither of us ourselves. Everything seemed to me like a bad dream--\\n', 'from the stamping of the horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the\\n', 'story of his loving Edith Copleigh since the first. He was still clawing my\\n', 'shoulder and begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was, when another\\n', 'lull came and brought light with it, and we saw the dust-cloud forming on the\\n', 'plain in front of us. So we knew the worst was over. The moon was low down,\\n', 'and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about an hour\\n', 'before the real one. But the light was very faint, and the dun cloud roared\\n', 'like a bull. I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone; and as I was wondering\\n', \"I saw three things together: First Maud Copleigh's face come smiling out of\\n\", 'the darkness and move towards Saumarez, who was standing by me. I heard the\\n', 'girl whisper, \"George,\" and slide her arm through the arm that was not clawing\\n', 'my shoulder, and I saw that look on her face which only comes once or twice in\\n', 'a lifetime--when a woman is perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets\\n', 'and gorgeous-colored fire and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and\\n', \"is loved. At the same time, I saw Saumarez's face as he heard Maud Copleigh's\\n\", 'voice, and fifty yards away from the clump of orange-trees I saw a brown\\n', 'holland habit getting upon a horse.\\n', '\\n', 'It must have been my state of over-excitement that made me so quick to meddle\\n', 'with what did not concern me. Saumarez was moving off to the habit; but I\\n', 'pushed him back and said:--\"Stop here and explain. I\\'ll fetch her back!\" and I\\n', 'ran out to get at my own horse. I had a perfectly unnecessary notion that\\n', \"everything must be done decently and in order, and that Saumarez's first care\\n\", \"was to wipe the happy look out of Maud Copleigh's face. All the time I was\\n\", 'linking up the curb-chain I wondered how he would do it.\\n', '\\n', 'I cantered after Edith Copleigh, thinking to bring her back slowly on some\\n', 'pretence or another. But she galloped away as soon as she saw me, and I was\\n', 'forced to ride after her in earnest. She called back over her shoulder--\"Go\\n', 'away! I\\'m going home. Oh, go away!\" two or three times; but my business was to\\n', 'catch her first, and argue later. The ride just fitted in with the rest of the\\n', 'evil dream. The ground was very bad, and now and again we rushed through the\\n', 'whirling, choking \"dust-devils\" in the skirts of the flying storm. There was a\\n', 'burning hot wind blowing that brought up a stench of stale brick-kilns with\\n', 'it; and through the half light and through the dust-devils, across that\\n', 'desolate plain, flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse. She\\n', 'headed for the Station at first. Then she wheeled round and set off for the\\n', 'river through beds of burnt down jungle-grass, bad even to ride a pig over. In\\n', 'cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country at night,\\n', 'but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning crackling overhead,\\n', 'and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils. I rode and shouted, and\\n', 'she bent forward and lashed her horse, and the aftermath of the dust-storm\\n', 'came up and caught us both, and drove us downwind like pieces of paper.\\n', '\\n', \"I don't know how far we rode; but the drumming of the horse-hoofs and the roar\\n\", 'of the wind and the race of the faint blood-red moon through the yellow mist\\n', 'seemed to have gone on for years and years, and I was literally drenched with\\n', 'sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray stumbled, recovered himself,\\n', 'and pulled up dead lame. My brute was used up altogether. Edith Copleigh was\\n', 'in a sad state, plastered with dust, her helmet off, and crying bitterly. \"Why\\n', 'can\\'t you let me alone?\" she said. \"I only wanted to get away and go home. Oh,\\n', 'PLEASE let me go!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have got to come back with me, Miss Copleigh. Saumarez has something to\\n', 'say to you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was a foolish way of putting it; but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh; and,\\n', 'though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse, I could not tell her\\n', 'in as many words what Saumarez had told me. I thought he could do that better\\n', 'himself. All her pretence about being tired and wanting to go home broke down,\\n', 'and she rocked herself to and fro in the saddle as she sobbed, and the hot\\n', 'wind blew her black hair to leeward. I am not going to repeat what she said,\\n', 'because she was utterly unstrung.\\n', '\\n', 'This, if you please, was the cynical Miss Copleigh. Here was I, almost an\\n', 'utter stranger to her, trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her and she was\\n', 'to come back to hear him say so! I believe I made myself understood, for she\\n', 'gathered the gray together and made him hobble somehow, and we set off for the\\n', 'tomb, while the storm went thundering down to Umballa and a few big drops of\\n', 'warm rain fell. I found out that she had been standing close to Saumarez when\\n', 'he proposed to her sister and had wanted to go home and cry in peace, as an\\n', 'English girl should. She dabbled her eyes with her pocket-handkerchief as we\\n', 'went along, and babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria.\\n', 'That was perfectly unnatural; and yet, it seemed all right at the time and in\\n', 'the place. All the world was only the two Copleigh girls, Saumarez and I,\\n', 'ringed in with the lightning and the dark; and the guidance of this misguided\\n', 'world seemed to lie in my hands.\\n', '\\n', 'When we returned to the tomb in the deep, dead stillness that followed the\\n', 'storm, the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away. They were waiting\\n', 'for our return. Saumarez most of all.\\n', '\\n', 'His face was white and drawn. As Miss Copleigh and I limped up, he came\\n', 'forward to meet us, and, when he helped her down from her saddle, he kissed\\n', 'her before all the picnic. It was like a scene in a theatre, and the likeness\\n', 'was heightened by all the dust-white, ghostly-looking men and women under the\\n', 'orange-trees, clapping their hands, as if they were watching a play--at\\n', \"Saumarez's choice. I never knew anything so un-English in my life.\\n\", '\\n', 'Lastly, Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come out to\\n', 'look for us, and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud Copleigh?\\n', 'Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I said.\\n', '\\n', 'So, we formed up, six couples in all, and went back two by two; Saumarez\\n', 'walking at the side of Edith Copleigh, who was riding his horse.\\n', '\\n', 'The air was cleared; and little by little, as the sun rose, I felt we were all\\n', 'dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that the \"Great Pop\\n', 'Picnic\" was a thing altogether apart and out of the world--never to happen\\n', 'again.

But Pluffles had got himself engaged to a girl in\\n', 'England the last time he went home; and if there was one thing more than\\n', 'another which the Colonel detested, it was a married subaltern. He chuckled\\n', 'when he heard of the education of Pluffles, and said it was \"good training for\\n', 'the boy.\" But it was not good training in the least.

She spoke with a sort of throaty quaver in her voice which had a\\n', 'soothing effect, though what she said was anything but soothing. She pointed\\n', \"out the exceeding folly, not to say meanness, of Pluffles' conduct, and the\\n\", 'smallness of his views.

There were seasons before\\n', 'that, if you will believe me, when even croquet had not been invented, and\\n', 'archery--which was revived in England in 1844--was as great a pest as lawn-\\n', 'tennis is now.

They shot, and they shot, and\\n', 'they kept on shooting, till the sun left the valley, and little breezes got up\\n', 'in the deodars, and people waited for Miss Beighton to shoot and win.

It was out of the ordinary\\n', 'and most improper. Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense deliberation, so\\n', 'that every one might see what she was doing. She was a perfect shot; and her\\n', '46-pound bow suited her to a nicety. She pinned the wooden legs of the target\\n', 'with great care four successive times. She pinned the wooden top of the target\\n', 'once, and all the ladies looked at each other. Then she began some fancy\\n', 'shooting at the white, which, if you hit it, counts exactly one point. She put\\n', 'five arrows into the white. It was wonderful archery; but, seeing that her\\n', 'business was to make \"golds\" and win the bracelet, Barr-Saggott turned a\\n', 'delicate green like young water-grass. Next, she shot over the target twice,\\n', 'then wide to the left twice--always with the same deliberation--while a chilly\\n', 'hush fell over the company, and Mrs. Beighton took out her handkerchief. Then\\n', 'Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target, and split several arrows.\\n', 'Then she made a red--or seven points--just to show what she could do if she\\n', 'liked, and finished up her amazing performance with some more fancy shooting\\n', 'at the target-supports.

It wears off in time; but they all catch it in the beginning, because\\n', 'they are new to the country.\\n', '\\n', 'The particular Viceroy who was suffering from the complaint just then--this\\n', 'was a long time ago, before Lord Dufferin ever came from Canada, or Lord Ripon\\n', 'from the bosom of the English Church--had it very badly; and the result was\\n', 'that men who were new to keeping official secrets went about looking unhappy;\\n', 'and the Viceroy plumed himself on the way in which he had instilled notions of\\n', 'reticence into his Staff.\\n', '\\n', 'Now, the Supreme Government have a careless custom of committing what they do\\n', 'to printed papers. These papers deal with all sorts of things--from the\\n', 'payment of Rs. 200 to a \"secret service\" native, up to rebukes administered to\\n', 'Vakils and Motamids of Native States, and rather brusque letters to Native\\n', 'Princes, telling them to put their houses in order, to refrain from kidnapping\\n', 'women, or filling offenders with pounded red pepper, and eccentricities of\\n', 'that kind. Of course, these things could never be made public, because Native\\n', 'Princes never err officially, and their States are, officially, as well\\n', 'administered as Our territories. Also, the private allowances to various queer\\n', 'people are not exactly matters to put into newspapers, though they give quaint\\n', 'reading sometimes.\\n', '\\n', 'When the Supreme Government is at Simla, these papers are prepared there, and\\n', 'go round to the people who ought to see them in office-boxes or by post. The\\n', 'principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy quite as important as the practice,\\n', 'and he held that a benevolent despotism like Ours should never allow even\\n', 'little things, such as appointments of subordinate clerks, to leak out till\\n', 'the proper time. He was always remarkable for his principles.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time. It had\\n', 'to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand.\\n', '\\n', 'It was not put into an official envelope, but a large, square, pale-pink one;\\n', 'the matter being in MS. on soft crinkly paper. It was addressed to \"The Head\\n', 'Clerk, etc., etc.\" Now, between \"The Head Clerk, etc., etc.,\" and \"Mrs.\\n', 'Hauksbee\" and a flourish, is no very great difference if the address be\\n', 'written in a very bad hand, as this was. The chaprassi who took the envelope\\n', 'was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis. He merely forgot where this\\n', 'most unofficial cover was to be delivered, and so asked the first Englishman\\n', 'he met, who happened to be a man riding down to Annandale in a great hurry.\\n', 'The Englishman hardly looked, said: \"Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem,\" and went on. So\\n', 'did the chaprassi, because that letter was the last in stock and he wanted to\\n', 'get his work over. There was no book to sign; he thrust the letter into Mrs.\\n', \"Hauksbee's bearer's hands and went off to smoke with a friend.\\n\", '\\n', 'Mrs. Hauksbee was expecting some cut-out pattern things in flimsy paper from a\\n', 'friend. As soon as she got the big square packet, therefore, she said, \"Oh,\\n', 'the DEAR creature!\" and tore it open with a paper-knife, and all the MS.\\n', 'enclosures tumbled out on the floor.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hauksbee began reading. I have said the batch was rather important. That\\n', 'is quite enough for you to know. It referred to some correspondence, two\\n', 'measures, a peremptory order to a native chief and two dozen other things.\\n', 'Mrs. Hauksbee gasped as she read, for the first glimpse of the naked machinery\\n', 'of the Great Indian Government, stripped of its casings, and lacquer, and\\n', 'paint, and guard-rails, impresses even the most stupid man. And Mrs. Hauksbee\\n', 'was a clever woman. She was a little afraid at first, and felt as if she had\\n', 'laid hold of a lightning-flash by the tail, and did not quite know what to do\\n', 'with it. There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers; and some\\n', 'of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers. The initials belonged\\n', 'to men who are all dead or gone now; but they were great in their day.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read. Then the value of her\\n', 'trove struck her, and she cast about for the best method of using it. Then\\n', 'Tarrion dropped in, and they read through all the papers together, and\\n', 'Tarrion, not knowing how she had come by them, vowed that Mrs. Hauksbee was\\n', 'the greatest woman on earth.\\n', '\\n', 'Which I believe was true, or nearly so.\\n', '\\n', '\"The honest course is always the best,\" said Tarrion after an hour and a half\\n', 'of study and conversation. \"All things considered, the Intelligence Branch is\\n', 'about my form. Either that or the Foreign Office.

So they translated him. They must have suspected him,\\n', 'though he protested that his information was due to singular talents of his\\n', 'own.

The Government\\n\", 'sends out weird Civilians now and again; but McGoggin was the queerest\\n', 'exported for a long time. He was clever--brilliantly clever--but his\\n', 'cleverness worked the wrong way. Instead of keeping to the study of the\\n', 'vernaculars, he had read some books written by a man called Comte, I think,\\n', 'and a man called Spencer, and a Professor Clifford.

There was no order against his reading them; but his\\n', 'Mamma should have smacked him.\\n', '\\n', 'They fermented in his head, and he came out to India with a rarefied religion\\n', 'over and above his work. It was not much of a creed. It only proved that men\\n', 'had no souls, and there was no God and no hereafter, and that you must worry\\n', 'along somehow for the good of Humanity.\\n', '\\n', 'One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than\\n', 'giving an order was obeying it. At least, that was what McGoggin said; but I\\n', 'suspect he had misread his primers.\\n', '\\n', 'I do not say a word against this creed. It was made up in Town, where there is\\n', 'nothing but machinery and asphalt and building--all shut in by the fog.\\n', 'Naturally, a man grows to think that there is no one higher than himself, and\\n', 'that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything. But in this country,\\n', 'where you really see humanity--raw, brown, naked humanity--with nothing\\n', 'between it and the blazing sky, and only the used-up, over-handled earth\\n', 'underfoot, the notion somehow dies away, and most folk come back to simpler\\n', 'theories. Life, in India, is not long enough to waste in proving that there is\\n', 'no one in particular at the head of affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'For this reason. The Deputy is above the Assistant, the Commissioner above the\\n', 'Deputy, the Lieutenant-Governor above the Commissioner, and the Viceroy above\\n', 'all four, under the orders of the Secretary of State, who is responsible to\\n', 'the Empress.

Men do not get \"beany\" in India. The\\n', 'climate and the work are against playing bricks with words.\\n', '\\n', 'If McGoggin had kept his creed, with the capital letters and the endings in\\n', '\"isms,\" to himself, no one would have cared; but his grandfathers on both\\n', 'sides had been Wesleyan preachers, and the preaching strain came out in his\\n', 'mind. He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no souls too, and\\n', 'to help him to eliminate his Creator. As a good many men told him, HE\\n', 'undoubtedly had no soul, because he was so young, but it did not follow that\\n', 'his seniors were equally undeveloped; and, whether there was another world or\\n', 'not, a man still wanted to read his papers in this. \"But that is not the\\n', 'point--that is not the point!\" Aurelian used to say. Then men threw sofa-\\n', 'cushions at him and told him to go to any particular place he might believe\\n', 'in. They christened him the \"Blastoderm\"--he said he came from a family of\\n', 'that name somewhere, in the pre-historic ages--and, by insult and laughter,\\n', 'strove to choke him dumb, for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club;\\n', 'besides being an offence to the older men. His Deputy Commissioner, who was\\n', 'working on the Frontier when Aurelian was rolling on a bed-quilt, told him\\n', 'that, for a clever boy, Aurelian was a very big idiot.

He was just the type that goes there--all head, no physique and a\\n', \"hundred theories. Not a soul was interested in McGoggin's soul. He might have\\n\", \"had two, or none, or somebody's else's. His business was to obey orders and\\n\", 'keep abreast of his files instead of devastating the Club with \"isms.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He worked brilliantly; but he could not accept any order without trying to\\n', 'better it. That was the fault of his creed. It made men too responsible and\\n', 'left too much to their honor. You can sometimes ride an old horse in a halter;\\n', 'but never a colt.\\n', '\\n', 'McGoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his year.

We were sitting in the verandah in the dead,\\n', 'hot, close air, gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds would let down\\n', 'and bring the cool. Very, very far away, there was a faint whisper, which was\\n', 'the roar of the Rains breaking over the river. One of the men heard it, got\\n', 'out of his chair, listened, and said, naturally enough:--\"Thank God!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and said:--\"Why? I assure you it\\'s\\n', 'only the result of perfectly natural causes--atmospheric phenomena of the\\n', 'simplest kind.

Then\\n', 'he handed the paper over.\\n', '\\n', '\"As I was saying,\" he went on slowly and with an effort--\"due to perfectly\\n', 'natural causes--perfectly natural causes. I mean--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hi! Blastoderm, you\\'ve given me the Calcutta Mercantile Advertiser.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The dust got up in little whorls, while the treetops rocked and the kites\\n', 'whistled. But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains.\\n', '\\n', 'We were all staring at the Blastoderm, who had risen from his chair and was\\n', 'fighting with his speech. Then he said, still more slowly:--\\n', '\\n', '\"Perfectly conceivable--dictionary--red oak--amenable--cause--retaining--\\n', 'shuttlecock--alone.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Blastoderm\\'s drunk,\" said one man. But the Blastoderm was not drunk. He\\n', 'looked at us in a dazed sort of way, and began motioning with his hands in the\\n', 'half light as the clouds closed overhead.\\n', '\\n', 'Then--with a scream:--\\n', '\\n', '\"What is it?--Can\\'t--reserve--attainable--market--obscure--\"\\n', '\\n', 'But his speech seemed to freeze in him, and--just as the lightning shot two\\n', 'tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell in\\n', 'quivering sheets--the Blastoderm was struck dumb. He stood pawing and champing\\n', 'like a hard-held horse, and his eyes were full of terror.\\n', '\\n', 'The Doctor came over in three minutes, and heard the story. \"It\\'s aphasia,\" he\\n', 'said. \"Take him to his room. I KNEW the smash would come.\" We carried the\\n', 'Blastoderm across, in the pouring rain, to his quarters, and the Doctor gave\\n', 'him bromide of potassium to make him sleep.\\n', '\\n', 'Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all the\\n', 'arrears of \"Punjab Head\" falling in a lump; and that only once before--in the\\n', 'case of a sepoy--had he met with so complete a case. I myself have seen mild\\n', 'aphasia in an overworked man, but this sudden dumbness was uncanny--though, as\\n', 'the Blastoderm himself might have said, due to \"perfectly natural causes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'ll have to take leave after this,\" said the Doctor. \"He won\\'t be fit for\\n', \"work for another three months. No; it isn't insanity or anything like it. It's\\n\", 'only complete loss of control over the speech and memory. I fancy it will keep\\n', 'the Blastoderm quiet, though.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Two days later, the Blastoderm found his tongue again. The first question he\\n', 'asked was: \"What was it?\" The Doctor enlightened him.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I can\\'t understand it!\" said the Blastoderm; \"I\\'m quite sane; but I can\\'t\\n', 'be sure of my mind, it seems--my OWN memory--can I?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Go up into the Hills for three months, and don\\'t think about it,\" said the\\n', 'Doctor.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I can\\'t understand it,\" repeated the Blastoderm. \"It was my OWN mind and\\n', 'memory.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can\\'t help it,\" said the Doctor; \"there are a good many things you can\\'t\\n', \"understand; and, by the time you have put in my length of service, you'll know\\n\", 'exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The stroke cowed the Blastoderm. He could not understand it. He went into the\\n', 'Hills in fear and trembling, wondering whether he would be permitted to reach\\n', 'the end of any sentence he began.\\n', '\\n', 'This gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust. The legitimate explanation,\\n', 'that he had been overworking himself, failed to satisfy him. Something had\\n', 'wiped his lips of speech, as a mother wipes the milky lips of her child, and\\n', 'he was afraid--horribly afraid.\\n', '\\n', 'So the Club had rest when he returned; and if ever you come across Aurelian\\n', \"McGoggin laying down the law on things Human--he doesn't seem to know as much\\n\", 'as he used to about things Divine--put your forefinger on your lip for a\\n', 'moment, and see what happens.\\n', '\\n', \"Don't blame me if he throws a glass at your head!\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'A GERM DESTROYER.\\n', '\\n', 'Pleasant it is for the Little Tin Gods,\\n', '  When great Jove nods;\\n', 'But Little Tin Gods make their little mistakes\\n', '  In missing the hour when great Jove wakes.\\n', '\\n', 'As a general rule, it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of State in a\\n', 'land where men are highly paid to work them out for you.\\n', '\\n', 'This tale is a justifiable exception.\\n', '\\n', 'Once in every five years, as you know, we indent for a new Viceroy; and each\\n', 'Viceroy imports, with the rest of his baggage, a Private Secretary, who may or\\n', 'may not be the real Viceroy, just as Fate ordains.

Then he told me, in jerks and quavers, that the man who said he cut\\n', 'seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind; that every day he gave Suddhoo news\\n', 'of the sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly, and\\n', 'that this news was always corroborated by the letters. Further, that he had\\n', 'told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son, which could be\\n', 'removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment. I began to see how the\\n', 'land lay, and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo in the\\n', 'Western line, and would go to his house to see that everything was done\\n', 'decently and in order. We set off together; and on the way Suddhoo told me he\\n', 'had paid the seal-cutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already;\\n', 'and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more. Which was cheap, he\\n', \"said, considering the greatness of his son's danger; but I do not think he\\n\", 'meant it.\\n', '\\n', 'The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived. I could\\n', \"hear awful noises from behind the seal-cutter's shop-front, as if some one\\n\", 'were groaning his soul out. Suddhoo shook all over, and while we groped our\\n', 'way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun. Janoo and Azizun met us at the\\n', 'stair-head, and told us that the jadoo-work was coming off in their rooms,\\n', 'because there was more space there. Janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of\\n', 'mind. She whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out of\\n', 'Suddhoo, and that the seal-cutter would go to a hot place when he died.\\n', 'Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age. He kept walking up and down\\n', \"the room in the half light, repeating his son's name over and over again, and\\n\", 'asking Azizun if the seal-cutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of\\n', 'his own landlord.\\n', '\\n', 'Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow-windows.\\n', 'The boards were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny lamp. There was no\\n', 'chance of my being seen if I stayed still.\\n', '\\n', 'Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on the staircase. That\\n', 'was the seal-cutter. He stopped outside the door as the terrier barked and\\n', 'Azizun fumbled at the chain, and he told Suddhoo to blow out the lamp. This\\n', 'left the place in jet darkness, except for the red glow from the two huqas\\n', 'that belonged to Janoo and Azizun. The seal-cutter came in, and I heard\\n', 'Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan. Azizun caught her breath,\\n', 'and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a shudder. There was a clink of\\n', 'something metallic, and then shot up a pale blue-green flame near the ground.\\n', 'The light was just enough to show Azizun, pressed against one corner of the\\n', 'room with the terrier between her knees; Janoo, with her hands clasped,\\n', 'leaning forward as she sat on the bed; Suddhoo, face down, quivering, and the\\n', 'seal-cutter.\\n', '\\n', 'I hope I may never see another man like that seal-cutter. He was stripped to\\n', 'the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round his\\n', 'forehead, a salmon-colored loin-cloth round his middle, and a steel bangle on\\n', 'each ankle. This was not awe-inspiring. It was the face of the man that turned\\n', 'me cold. It was blue-gray in the first place. In the second, the eyes were\\n', 'rolled back till you could only see the whites of them; and, in the third, the\\n', 'face was the face of a demon--a ghoul--anything you please except of the\\n', 'sleek, oily old ruffian who sat in the day-time over his turning-lathe\\n', 'downstairs. He was lying on his stomach, with his arms turned and crossed\\n', 'behind him, as if he had been thrown down pinioned. His head and neck were the\\n', 'only parts of him off the floor. They were nearly at right angles to the body,\\n', 'like the head of a cobra at spring. It was ghastly. In the centre of the room,\\n', 'on the bare earth floor, stood a big, deep, brass basin, with a pale blue-\\n', 'green light floating in the centre like a night-light. Round that basin the\\n', 'man on the floor wriggled himself three times. How he did it I do not know. I\\n', 'could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again; but I\\n', 'could not see any other motion.\\n', '\\n', 'The head seemed the only thing alive about him, except that slow curl and\\n', 'uncurl of the laboring back-muscles. Janoo from the bed was breathing seventy\\n', 'to the minute; Azizun held her hands before her eyes; and old Suddhoo,\\n', 'fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard, was crying to\\n', 'himself. The horror of it was that the creeping, crawly thing made no sound--\\n', 'only crawled! And, remember, this lasted for ten minutes, while the terrier\\n', 'whined, and Azizun shuddered, and Janoo gasped, and Suddhoo cried.\\n', '\\n', 'I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart thump like a\\n', 'thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal-cutter betrayed himself by his most\\n', 'impressive trick and made me calm again. After he had finished that\\n', 'unspeakable triple crawl, he stretched his head away from the floor as high as\\n', 'he could, and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils. Now, I knew how fire-\\n', 'spouting is done--I can do it myself--so I felt at ease. The business was a\\n', 'fraud. If he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the effect,\\n', 'goodness knows what I might not have thought. Both the girls shrieked at the\\n', 'jet of fire and the head dropped, chin down, on the floor with a thud; the\\n', 'whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms trussed.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a pause of five full minutes after this, and the blue-green flame\\n', 'died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while Azizun turned her\\n', 'face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm\\n', \"mechanically to Janoo's huqa, and she slid it across the floor with her foot.\\n\", 'Directly above the body and on the wall, were a couple of flaming portraits,\\n', 'in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked\\n', 'down on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to heighten the\\n', 'grotesqueness of it all.\\n', '\\n', 'Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body turned over and rolled\\n', 'away from the basin to the side of the room, where it lay stomach up. There\\n', 'was a faint \"plop\" from the basin--exactly like the noise a fish makes when it\\n', 'takes a fly--and the green light in the centre revived.\\n', '\\n', 'I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water, the dried, shrivelled,\\n', 'black head of a native baby--open eyes, open mouth and shaved scalp. It was\\n', 'worse, being so very sudden, than the crawling exhibition. We had no time to\\n', 'say anything before it began to speak.\\n', '\\n', \"Read Poe's account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man, and\\n\", \"you will realize less than one-half of the horror of that head's voice.\\n\", '\\n', 'There was an interval of a second or two between each word, and a sort of\\n', '\"ring, ring, ring,\" in the note of the voice, like the timbre of a bell. It\\n', 'pealed slowly, as if talking to itself, for several minutes before I got rid\\n', 'of my cold sweat. Then the blessed solution struck me. I looked at the body\\n', 'lying near the doorway, and saw, just where the hollow of the throat joins on\\n', \"the shoulders, a muscle that had nothing to do with any man's regular\\n\", 'breathing, twitching away steadily. The whole thing was a careful reproduction\\n', 'of the Egyptian teraphin that one read about sometimes and the voice was as\\n', 'clever and as appalling a piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear.\\n', 'All this time the head was \"lip-lip-lapping\" against the side of the basin,\\n', \"and speaking. It told Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of his son's illness\\n\", 'and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night. I always\\n', 'shall respect the seal-cutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the\\n', 'Peshawar telegrams. It went on to say that skilled doctors were night and day\\n', \"watching over the man's life; and that he would eventually recover if the fee\\n\", 'to the potent sorcerer, whose servant was the head in the basin, were doubled.\\n', '\\n', 'Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in. To ask for twice\\n', 'your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used when he rose from\\n', 'the dead, is absurd. Janoo, who is really a woman of masculine intellect, saw\\n', 'this as quickly as I did. I heard her say \"Asli nahin! Fareib!\" scornfully\\n', 'under her breath; and just as she said so, the light in the basin died out,\\n', 'the head stopped talking, and we heard the room door creak on its hinges. Then\\n', 'Janoo struck a match, lit the lamp, and we saw that head, basin, and seal-\\n', 'cutter were gone. Suddhoo was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who\\n', 'cared to listen, that, if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it, he\\n', 'could not raise another two hundred rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in\\n', 'the corner; while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the\\n', 'probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao, or \"make-up.\"\\n', '\\n', \"I explained as much as I knew of the seal-cutter's way of jadoo; but her\\n\", 'argument was much more simple:--\"The magic that is always demanding gifts is\\n', 'no true magic,\" said she. \"My mother told me that the only potent love-spells\\n', 'are those which are told you for love. This seal-cutter man is a liar and a\\n', 'devil. I dare not tell, do anything, or get anything done, because I am in\\n', 'debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet. I must\\n', 'get my food from his shop. The seal-cutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass, and\\n', \"he would poison my food. A fool's jadoo has been going on for ten days, and\\n\", 'has cost Suddhoo many rupees each night. The seal-cutter used black hens and\\n', 'lemons and mantras before. He never showed us anything like this till tonight.\\n', 'Azizun is a fool, and will be a purdah nashin soon. Suddhoo has lost his\\n', 'strength and his wits. See now! I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees\\n', 'while he lived, and many more after his death; and behold, he is spending\\n', 'everything on that offspring of a devil and a she-ass, the seal- cutter!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Here I said:--\"But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business? Of\\n', 'course I can speak to the seal-cutter, and he shall refund. The whole thing is\\n', 'child\\'s talk--shame--and senseless.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Suddhoo IS an old child,\" said Janoo. \"He has lived on the roofs these\\n', 'seventy years and is as senseless as a milch-goat. He brought you here to\\n', 'assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar, whose salt he\\n', 'ate many years ago. He worships the dust off the feet of the seal-cutter, and\\n', 'that cow-devourer has forbidden him to go and see his son. What does Suddhoo\\n', 'know of your laws or the lightning-post? I have to watch his money going day\\n', 'by day to that lying beast below.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation; while\\n', 'Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner, and Azizun was trying to\\n', 'guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth.\\n', '   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .\\n', '\\n', 'Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself open to the charge\\n', 'of aiding and abetting the seal-cutter in obtaining money under false\\n', 'pretences, which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. I am\\n', 'helpless in the matter for these reasons, I cannot inform the Police. What\\n', 'witnesses would support my statements? Janoo refuses flatly, Azizun is a\\n', 'veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly--lost in this big India of ours. I cannot\\n', 'again take the law into my own hands, and speak to the seal-cutter; for\\n', 'certain am I that, not only would Suddhoo disbelieve me, but this step would\\n', 'end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is bound hand and foot by her debt to the\\n', 'bunnia. Suddhoo is an old dotard; and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke\\n', 'that the Sirkar rather patronizes the Black Art than otherwise. His son is\\n', 'well now; but Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the seal-cutter, by\\n', 'whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life.

The safest plan is never to tread\\n', 'on a worm--not even on the last new subaltern from Home, with his buttons\\n', 'hardly out of their tissue paper, and the red of sappy English beef in his\\n', 'cheeks. This is the story of the worm that turned. For the sake of brevity, we\\n', 'will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, \"The Worm,\" although he really was\\n', 'an exceedingly pretty boy, without a hair on his face, and with a waist like a\\n', 'girl\\'s when he came out to the Second \"Shikarris\" and was made unhappy in\\n', 'several ways. The \"Shikarris\" are a high-caste regiment, and you must be able\\n', 'to do things well--play a banjo or ride more than a little, or sing, or act--\\n', 'to get on with them.\\n', '\\n', 'The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony, and knock chips out of gate-\\n', 'posts with his trap. Even that became monotonous after a time. He objected to\\n', 'whist, cut the cloth at billiards, sang out of tune, kept very much to\\n', 'himself, and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home. Four of these five things\\n', 'were vices which the \"Shikarris\" objected to and set themselves to eradicate.\\n', 'Every one knows how subalterns are, by brother subalterns, softened and not\\n', 'permitted to be ferocious. It is good and wholesome, and does no one any harm,\\n', 'unless tempers are lost; and then there is trouble. There was a man once--but\\n', 'that is another story.\\n', '\\n', 'The \"Shikarris\" shikarred The Worm very much, and he bore everything without\\n', 'winking. He was so good and so anxious to learn, and flushed so pink, that his\\n', 'education was cut short, and he was left to his own devices by every one\\n', 'except the Senior Subaltern, who continued to make life a burden to The Worm.\\n', \"The Senior Subaltern meant no harm; but his chaff was coarse, and he didn't\\n\", 'quite understand where to stop. He had been waiting too long for his company;\\n', 'and that always sours a man. Also he was in love, which made him worse.\\n', '\\n', \"One day, after he had borrowed The Worm's trap for a lady who never existed,\\n\", 'had used it himself all the afternoon, had sent a note to The Worm purporting\\n', 'to come from the lady, and was telling the Mess all about it, The Worm rose in\\n', 'his place and said, in his quiet, ladylike voice: \"That was a very pretty\\n', \"sell; but I'll lay you a month's pay to a month's pay when you get your step,\\n\", \"that I work a sell on you that you'll remember for the rest of your days, and\\n\", 'the Regiment after you when you\\'re dead or broke.\" The Worm wasn\\'t angry in\\n', 'the least, and the rest of the Mess shouted. Then the Senior Subaltern looked\\n', 'at The Worm from the boots upwards, and down again, and said, \"Done, Baby.\"\\n', 'The Worm took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken, and\\n', 'retired into a book with a sweet smile.\\n', '\\n', 'Two months passed, and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm, who began\\n', 'to move about a little more as the hot weather came on. I have said that the\\n', 'Senior Subaltern was in love. The curious thing is that a girl was in love\\n', 'with the Senior Subaltern. Though the Colonel said awful things, and the\\n', 'Majors snorted, and married Captains looked unutterable wisdom, and the\\n', 'juniors scoffed, those two were engaged.\\n', '\\n', 'The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his\\n', 'acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm. The girl was a\\n', 'pretty girl, and had money of her own. She does not come into this story at\\n', 'all.\\n', '\\n', 'One night, at the beginning of the hot weather, all the Mess, except The Worm,\\n', 'who had gone to his own room to write Home letters, were sitting on the\\n', 'platform outside the Mess House. The Band had finished playing, but no one\\n', \"wanted to go in. And the Captains' wives were there also. The folly of a man\\n\", 'in love is unlimited.\\n', '\\n', 'The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl he was\\n', 'engaged to, and the ladies were purring approval, while the men yawned, when\\n', 'there was a rustle of skirts in the dark, and a tired, faint voice lifted\\n', 'itself:\\n', '\\n', '\"Where\\'s my husband?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the \"Shikarris;\" but\\n', 'it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had been shot. Three of\\n', 'them were married men. Perhaps they were afraid that their wives had come from\\n', 'Home unbeknownst. The fourth said that he had acted on the impulse of the\\n', 'moment. He explained this afterwards.\\n', '\\n', 'Then the voice cried:--\"Oh, Lionel!\" Lionel was the Senior Subaltern\\'s name. A\\n', 'woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on the peg-tables,\\n', 'stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior Subaltern was, and\\n', 'sobbing. We rose to our feet, feeling that things were going to happen and\\n', 'ready to believe the worst. In this bad, small world of ours, one knows so\\n', 'little of the life of the next man--which, after all, is entirely his own\\n', 'concern--that one is not surprised when a crash comes. Anything might turn up\\n', 'any day for any one. Perhaps the Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his\\n', \"youth. Men are crippled that way occasionally. We didn't know; we wanted to\\n\", \"hear; and the Captains' wives were as anxious as we. If he HAD been trapped,\\n\", 'he was to be excused; for the woman from nowhere, in the dusty shoes, and gray\\n', 'travelling dress, was very lovely, with black hair and great eyes full of\\n', 'tears. She was tall, with a fine figure, and her voice had a running sob in it\\n', 'pitiful to hear. As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up, she threw her arms\\n', 'round his neck, and called him \"my darling,\" and said she could not bear\\n', 'waiting alone in England, and his letters were so short and cold, and she was\\n', 'his to the end of the world, and would he forgive her. This did not sound\\n', \"quite like a lady's way of speaking. It was too demonstrative.\\n\", '\\n', \"Things seemed black indeed, and the Captains' wives peered under their\\n\", \"eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern, and the Colonel's face set like the Day of\\n\", 'Judgment framed in gray bristles, and no one spoke for a while.\\n', '\\n', 'Next the Colonel said, very shortly:--\"Well, Sir?\" and the woman sobbed\\n', 'afresh. The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his neck, but\\n', 'he gasped out:--\"It\\'s a d----d lie! I never had a wife in my life!\" \"Don\\'t\\n', 'swear,\" said the Colonel. \"Come into the Mess. We must sift this clear\\n', 'somehow,\" and he sighed to himself, for he believed in his \"Shikarris,\" did\\n', 'the Colonel.\\n', '\\n', 'We trooped into the ante-room, under the full lights, and there we saw how\\n', 'beautiful the woman was. She stood up in the middle of us all, sometimes\\n', 'choking with crying, then hard and proud, and then holding out her arms to the\\n', 'Senior Subaltern. It was like the fourth act of a tragedy. She told us how the\\n', 'Senior Subaltern had married her when he was Home on leave eighteen months\\n', 'before; and she seemed to know all that we knew, and more too, of his people\\n', 'and his past life. He was white and ashy gray, trying now and again to break\\n', 'into the torrent of her words; and we, noting how lovely she was and what a\\n', 'criminal he looked, esteemed him a beast of the worst kind. We felt sorry for\\n', 'him, though.\\n', '\\n', 'I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife. Nor\\n', 'will he. It was so sudden, rushing out of the dark, unannounced, into our dull\\n', \"lives. The Captains' wives stood back; but their eyes were alight, and you\\n\", 'could see that they had already convicted and sentenced the Senior Subaltern.\\n', 'The Colonel seemed five years older. One Major was shading his eyes with his\\n', 'hand and watching the woman from underneath it. Another was chewing his\\n', 'moustache and smiling quietly as if he were witnessing a play. Full in the\\n', \"open space in the centre, by the whist-tables, the Senior Subaltern's terrier\\n\", 'was hunting for fleas. I remember all this as clearly as though a photograph\\n', \"were in my hand. I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern's face.\\n\", 'It was rather like seeing a man hanged; but much more interesting. Finally,\\n', 'the woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F. M.\\n', 'in tattoo on his left shoulder. We all knew that, and to our innocent minds it\\n', 'seemed to clinch the matter. But one of the Bachelor Majors said very\\n', 'politely:--\"I presume that your marriage certificate would be more to the\\n', 'purpose?\"\\n', '\\n', 'That roused the woman. She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern for a\\n', 'cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest. Then she wept, and\\n', 'then she pulled a paper from her breast, saying imperially:--\"Take that! And\\n', 'let my husband--my lawfully wedded husband--read it aloud--if he dare!\"\\n', '\\n', \"There was a hush, and the men looked into each other's eyes as the Senior\\n\", 'Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and took the paper. We were\\n', 'wondering as we stared, whether there was anything against any one of us that\\n', \"might turn up later on. The Senior Subaltern's throat was dry; but, as he ran\\n\", 'his eye over the paper, he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief, and said\\n', 'to the woman:--\"You young blackguard!\"\\n', '\\n', 'But the woman had fled through a door, and on the paper was written:--\"This is\\n', 'to certify that I, The Worm, have paid in full my debts to the Senior\\n', 'Subaltern, and, further, that the Senior Subaltern is my debtor, by agreement\\n', \"on the 23d of February, as by the Mess attested, to the extent of one month's\\n\", 'Captain\\'s pay, in the lawful currency of the India Empire.\"\\n', '                                                            \\n', \"Then a deputation set off for The Worm's quarters and found him, betwixt and\\n\", 'between, unlacing his stays, with the hat, wig, serge dress, etc., on the bed.\\n', 'He came over as he was, and the \"Shikarris\" shouted till the Gunners\\' Mess\\n', 'sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun. I think we were all,\\n', 'except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern, a little disappointed that the\\n', 'scandal had come to nothing. But that is human nature. There could be no two\\n', \"words about The Worm's acting. It leaned as near to a nasty tragedy as\\n\", 'anything this side of a joke can. When most of the Subalterns sat upon him\\n', 'with sofa-cushions to find out why he had not said that acting was his strong\\n', 'point, he answered very quietly:--\"I don\\'t think you ever asked me. I used to\\n', 'act at Home with my sisters.\" But no acting with girls could account for The\\n', \"Worm's display that night. Personally, I think it was in bad taste.\\n\", '\\n', 'Besides being dangerous. There is no sort of use in playing with fire, even\\n', 'for fun.\\n', '\\n', 'The \"Shikarris\" made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club; and, when\\n', 'the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt, which he did at once, The Worm sank the\\n', 'money in scenery and dresses. He was a good Worm; and the \"Shikarris\" are\\n', 'proud of him. The only drawback is that he has been christened \"Mrs. Senior\\n', 'Subaltern;\" and as there are now two Mrs. Senior Subalterns in the Station,\\n', 'this is sometimes confusing to strangers.\\n', '\\n', 'Later on, I will tell you of a case something like, this, but with all the\\n', 'jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.\\n', '\\n', 'While the snaffle holds, or the \"long-neck\" stings,\\n', 'While the big beam tilts, or the last bell rings,\\n', 'While horses are horses to train and to race,\\n', 'Then women and wine take a second place\\n', '    For me--for me--\\n', '     While a short \"ten-three\"\\n', 'Has a field to squander or fence to face!\\n', '               ----Song of the G.

At last he was bought by a man\\n', 'who discovered that, if a race was to be won, Shackles, and Shackles only,\\n', 'would win it in his own way, so long as his jockey sat still.\\n', '\\n', 'This man had a riding-boy called Brunt--a lad from Perth, West Australia--and\\n', \"he taught Brunt, with a trainer's whip, the hardest thing a jock can learn--to\\n\", 'sit still, to sit still, and to keep on sitting still.

The astounding peculiarity of the course is that, if\\n', 'you stand at one particular place, about half a mile away, inside the course,\\n', 'and speak at an ordinary pitch, your voice just hits the funnel of the brick-\\n', 'mounds and makes a curious whining echo there. A man discovered this one\\n', 'morning by accident while out training with a friend.

The mare was, as a delicate tribute to Mrs. Reiver, called \"The Lady\\n', 'Regula Baddun\"--or for short, Regula Baddun.\\n', '\\n', \"Shackles' jockey, Brunt, was a quiet, well-behaved boy, but his nerves had\\n\", 'been shaken. He began his career by riding jump-races in Melbourne, where a\\n', 'few Stewards want lynching, and was one of the jockeys who came through the\\n', 'awful butchery--perhaps you will recollect it--of the Maribyrnong Plate. The\\n', 'walls were colonial ramparts--logs of jarrak spiked into masonry--with wings\\n', 'as strong as Church buttresses. Once in his stride, a horse had to jump or\\n', \"fall. He couldn't run out. In the Maribyrnong Plate, twelve horses were jammed\\n\", 'at the second wall. Red Hat, leading, fell this side, and threw out The Glen,\\n', 'and the ruck came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one\\n', 'struggling, screaming, kicking shambles. Four jockeys were taken out dead;\\n', 'three were very badly hurt, and Brunt was among the three. He told the story\\n', 'of the Maribyrnong Plate sometimes; and when he described how Whalley on Red\\n', 'Hat, said, as the mare fell under him:--\"God ha\\' mercy, I\\'m done for!\" and\\n', 'how, next instant, Sithee There and White Otter had crushed the life out of\\n', 'poor Whalley, and the dust hid a small hell of men and horses, no one\\n', 'marvelled that Brunt had dropped jump-races and Australia together.

He got his\\n', 'dismissal, and crept up to the paddock, white as chalk, with blue lips, his\\n', 'knees giving way under him. People said nasty things in the paddock; but Brunt\\n', 'never heeded.

The message ran then:--\"A widow dhak flower\\n', 'and bhusa--at eleven o\\'clock.\" The pinch of bhusa enlightened Trejago.

The past\\n', 'ten days had been very bad ones, and the end of it all was that he received\\n', 'the arrears of two and three-quarter years of sipping in one attack of\\n', 'delirium tremens of the subdued kind; beginning with suicidal depression,\\n', 'going on to fits and starts and hysteria, and ending with downright raving. As\\n', 'he sat in a chair in front of the fire, or walked up and down the room picking\\n', 'a handkerchief to pieces, you heard what poor Moriarty really thought of Mrs.\\n', 'Reiver, for he raved about her and his own fall for the most part; though he\\n', 'ravelled some P.

He seemed to know that there was something wrong, and twice tried to pull\\n', 'himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor; but his mind ran out\\n', 'of control at once, and he fell back to a whisper and the story of his\\n', 'troubles.

He was\\n', 'perfectly correct. Mr. Silas Riley, Accountant, was a MOST curious animal--a\\n', 'long, gawky, rawboned Yorkshireman, full of the savage self-conceit that\\n', 'blossoms only in the best county in England. Arrogance was a mild word for the\\n', 'mental attitude of Mr. S. Riley. He had worked himself up, after seven years,\\n', \"to a Cashier's position in a Huddersfield Bank; and all his experience lay\\n\", 'among the factories of the North. Perhaps he would have done better on the\\n', 'Bombay side, where they are happy with one-half per cent. profits, and money\\n', 'is cheap. He was useless for Upper India and a wheat Province, where a man\\n', 'wants a large head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a\\n', 'satisfactory balance-sheet.\\n', '\\n', 'He was wonderfully narrow-minded in business, and, being new to the country,\\n', 'had no notion that Indian banking is totally distinct from Home work. Like\\n', 'most clever self-made men, he had much simplicity in his nature; and, somehow\\n', 'or other, had construed the ordinarily polite terms of his letter of\\n', 'engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen him on account of his\\n', 'special and brilliant talents, and that they set great store by him. This\\n', 'notion grew and crystallized; thus adding to his natural North-country\\n', 'conceit.\\n', '\\n', 'Further, he was delicate, suffered from some trouble in his chest, and was\\n', 'short in his temper.\\n', '\\n', 'You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a Natural\\n', 'Curiosity. The two men failed to hit it off at all. Riley considered Reggie a\\n', 'wild, feather-headed idiot, given to Heaven only knew what dissipation in low\\n', 'places called \"Messes,\" and totally unfit for the serious and solemn vocation\\n', 'of banking. He could never get over Reggie\\'s look of youth and \"you-be-damned\"\\n', \"air; and he couldn't understand Reggie's friends--clean-built, careless men in\\n\", 'the Army--who rode over to big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank, and told sultry\\n', 'stories till Riley got up and left the room. Riley was always showing Reggie\\n', 'how the business ought to be conducted, and Reggie had more than once to\\n', \"remind him that seven years' limited experience between Huddersfield and\\n\", 'Beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big up-country business. Then Riley\\n', 'sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a cherished friend\\n', \"of the Directors, and Reggie tore his hair. If a man's English subordinates\\n\", 'fail him in this country, he comes to a hard time indeed, for native help has\\n', 'strict limitations. In the winter Riley went sick for weeks at a time with his\\n', 'lung complaint, and this threw more work on Reggie. But he preferred it to the\\n', 'everlasting friction when Riley was well.\\n', '\\n', 'One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses and\\n', 'reported them to the Directors. Now Riley had been foisted on the Bank by an\\n', \"M. P., who wanted the support of Riley's father, who, again, was anxious to\\n\", 'get his son out to a warmer climate because of those lungs. The M. P. had an\\n', 'interest in the Bank; but one of the Directors wanted to advance a nominee of\\n', \"his own; and, after Riley's father had died, he made the rest of the Board see\\n\", 'that an Accountant who was sick for half the year, had better give place to a\\n', 'healthy man. If Riley had known the real story of his appointment, he might\\n', 'have behaved better; but knowing nothing, his stretches of sickness alternated\\n', 'with restless, persistent, meddling irritation of Reggie, and all the hundred\\n', 'ways in which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play. Reggie used to\\n', 'call him striking and hair-curling names behind his back as a relief to his\\n', 'own feelings; but he never abused him to his face, because he said: \"Riley is\\n', 'such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due to pains in the\\n', 'chest.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Late one April, Riley went very sick indeed. The doctor punched him and\\n', 'thumped him, and told him he would be better before long. Then the doctor went\\n', 'to Reggie and said:--\"Do you know how sick your Accountant is?\" \"No!\" said\\n', 'Reggie--\"The worse the better, confound him! He\\'s a clacking nuisance when\\n', \"he's well. I'll let you take away the Bank Safe if you can drug him silent for\\n\", 'this hot-weather.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But the doctor did not laugh--\"Man, I\\'m not joking,\" he said. \"I\\'ll give him\\n', 'another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in. On my honor\\n', \"and reputation that's all the grace he has in this world. Consumption has hold\\n\", 'of him to the marrow.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Reggie\\'s face changed at once into the face of \"Mr. Reginald Burke,\" and he\\n', 'answered:--\"What can I do?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing,\" said the doctor. \"For all practical purposes the man is dead\\n', \"already. Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him he's going to recover.\\n\", 'That\\'s all. I\\'ll look after him to the end, of course.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The doctor went away, and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail.\\n', '\\n', 'His first letter was one from the Directors, intimating for his information\\n', \"that Mr. Riley was to resign, under a month's notice, by the terms of his\\n\", 'agreement, telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would follow and advising\\n', 'Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant, a man whom Reggie knew and liked.\\n', '\\n', 'Reggie lit a cheroot, and, before he had finished smoking, he had sketched the\\n', 'outline of a fraud. He put away--\"burked\"--the Directors letter, and went in\\n', 'to talk to Riley, who was as ungracious as usual, and fretting himself over\\n', 'the way the bank would run during his illness. He never thought of the extra\\n', \"work on Reggie's shoulders, but solely of the damage to his own prospects of\\n\", 'advancement. Then Reggie assured him that everything would be well, and that\\n', 'he, Reggie, would confer with Riley daily on the management of the Bank. Riley\\n', 'was a little soothed, but he hinted in as many words that he did not think\\n', \"much of Reggie's business capacity.\\n\", '\\n', 'Reggie was humble. And he had letters in his desk from the Directors that a\\n', 'Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of!\\n', '\\n', \"The days passed in the big darkened house, and the Directors' letter of\\n\", 'dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie, who, every evening,\\n', \"brought the books to Riley's room, and showed him what had been going forward,\\n\", 'while Riley snarled. Reggie did his best to make statements pleasing to Riley,\\n', 'but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going to rack and ruin without\\n', 'him. In June, as the lying in bed told on his spirit, he asked whether his\\n', 'absence had been noted by the Directors, and Reggie said that they had written\\n', 'most sympathetic letters, hoping that he would be able to resume his valuable\\n', 'services before long. He showed Riley the letters: and Riley said that the\\n', 'Directors ought to have written to him direct.\\n', '\\n', \"A few days later, Reggie opened Riley's mail in the half-light of the room,\\n\", 'and gave him the sheet--not the envelope--of a letter to Riley from the\\n', 'Directors. Riley said he would thank Reggie not to interfere with his private\\n', 'papers, specially as Reggie knew he was too weak to open his own letters.\\n', 'Reggie apologized.\\n', '\\n', \"Then Riley's mood changed, and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways: his horses\\n\", 'and his bad friends. \"Of course, lying here on my back, Mr. Burke, I can\\'t\\n', \"keep you straight; but when I'm well, I DO hope you'll pay some heed to my\\n\", 'words.\" Reggie, who had dropped polo, and dinners, and tennis, and all to\\n', \"attend to Riley, said that he was penitent and settled Riley's head on the\\n\", 'pillow and heard him fret and contradict in hard, dry, hacking whispers,\\n', \"without a sign of impatience. This at the end of a heavy day's office work,\\n\", 'doing double duty, in the latter half of June.\\n', '\\n', 'When the new Accountant came, Reggie told him the facts of the case, and\\n', 'announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him. Riley said that he\\n', 'might have had more consideration than to entertain his \"doubtful friends\" at\\n', 'such a time. Reggie made Carron, the new Accountant, sleep at the Club in\\n', \"consequence. Carron's arrival took some of the heavy work off his shoulders,\\n\", \"and he had time to attend to Riley's exactions--to explain, soothe, invent,\\n\", 'and settle and resettle the poor wretch in bed, and to forge complimentary\\n', 'letters from Calcutta. At the end of the first month, Riley wished to send\\n', 'some money home to his mother. Reggie sent the draft. At the end of the second\\n', \"month, Riley's salary came in just the same. Reggie paid it out of his own\\n\", 'pocket; and, with it, wrote Riley a beautiful letter from the Directors.\\n', '\\n', 'Riley was very ill indeed, but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily. Now and\\n', 'then he would be cheerful and confident about the future, sketching plans for\\n', 'going Home and seeing his mother.\\n', '\\n', 'Reggie listened patiently when the office work was over, and encouraged him.\\n', '\\n', 'At other times Riley insisted on Reggie\\'s reading the Bible and grim \"Methody\"\\n', 'tracts to him. Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed at his Manager.\\n', 'But he always found time to worry Reggie about the working of the Bank, and to\\n', 'show him where the weak points lay.\\n', '\\n', 'This in-door, sick-room life and constant strains wore Reggie down a good\\n', 'deal, and shook his nerves, and lowered his billiard-play by forty points. But\\n', 'the business of the Bank, and the business of the sick-room, had to go on,\\n', 'though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade.\\n', '\\n', 'At the end of the third month, Riley was sinking fast, and had begun to\\n', 'realize that he was very sick. But the conceit that made him worry Reggie,\\n', 'kept him from believing the worst. \"He wants some sort of mental stimulant if\\n', 'he is to drag on,\" said the doctor.\\n', '\\n', '\"Keep him interested in life if you care about his living.\" So Riley, contrary\\n', 'to all the laws of business and the finance, received a 25-per-cent, rise of\\n', 'salary from the Directors. The \"mental stimulant\" succeeded beautifully. Riley\\n', 'was happy and cheerful, and, as is often the case in consumption, healthiest\\n', 'in mind when the body was weakest. He lingered for a full month, snarling and\\n', 'fretting about the Bank, talking of the future, hearing the Bible read,\\n', 'lecturing Reggie on sin, and wondering when he would be able to move abroad.\\n', '\\n', 'But at the end of September, one mercilessly hot evening, he rose up in his\\n', 'bed with a little gasp, and said quickly to Reggie:--\"Mr. Burke, I am going to\\n', \"die.

Of course, he spoke Urdu, but he had also\\n', 'mastered many queer side-speeches like the chotee bolee of the women, and held\\n', 'grave converse with shopkeepers and Hill-coolies alike. He was precocious for\\n', 'his age, and his mixing with natives had taught him some of the more bitter\\n', 'truths of life; the meanness and the sordidness of it. He used, over his bread\\n', 'and milk, to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms, translated from the\\n', 'vernacular into the English, that made his Mamma jump and vow that Tods MUST\\n', 'go home next hot weather.\\n', '\\n', 'Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power, the Supreme Legislature were\\n', 'hacking out a Bill, for the Sub-Montane Tracts, a revision of the then Act,\\n', 'smaller than the Punjab Land Bill, but affecting a few hundred thousand people\\n', 'none the less. The Legal Member had built, and bolstered, and embroidered, and\\n', 'amended that Bill, till it looked beautiful on paper. Then the Council began\\n', 'to settle what they called the \"minor details.\" As if any Englishman\\n', 'legislating for natives knows enough to know which are the minor and which are\\n', 'the major points, from the native point of view, of any measure! That Bill was\\n', 'a triumph of \"safe-guarding the interests of the tenant.\" One clause provided\\n', 'that land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch;\\n', 'because, if the landlord had a tenant bound down for, say, twenty years, he\\n', 'would squeeze the very life out of him. The notion was to keep up a stream of\\n', 'independent cultivators in the Sub-Montane Tracts; and ethnologically and\\n', 'politically the notion was correct. The only drawback was that it was\\n', \"altogether wrong. A native's life in India implies the life of his son.\\n\", 'Wherefore, you cannot legislate for one generation at a time. You must\\n', 'consider the next from the native point of view. Curiously enough, the native\\n', 'now and then, and in Northern India more particularly, hates being over-\\n', 'protected against himself. There was a Naga village once, where they lived on\\n', 'dead AND buried Commissariat mules . . . . But that is another story.\\n', '\\n', 'For many reasons, to be explained later, the people concerned objected to the\\n', 'Bill. The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as he knew\\n', 'about Charing Cross. He had said in Calcutta that \"the Bill was entirely in\\n', 'accord with the desires of that large and important class, the cultivators;\"\\n', \"and so on, and so on. The Legal Member's knowledge of natives was limited to\\n\", 'English-speaking Durbaris, and his own red chaprassis, the Sub-Montane Tracts\\n', 'concerned no one in particular, the Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too\\n', 'driven to make representations, and the measure was one which dealt with small\\n', 'landholders only. Nevertheless, the Legal Member prayed that it might be\\n', 'correct, for he was a nervously conscientious man. He did not know that no man\\n', 'can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off.\\n', 'And not always then. But he did the best he knew. And the measure came up to\\n', 'the Supreme Council for the final touches, while Tods patrolled the Burra\\n', 'Simla Bazar in his morning rides, and played with the monkey belonging to\\n', 'Ditta Mull, the bunnia, and listened, as a child listens to all the stray talk\\n', \"about this new freak of the Lat Sahib's.\\n\", '\\n', \"One day there was a dinner-party, at the house of Tods' Mamma, and the Legal\\n\", 'Member came. Tods was in bed, but he kept awake till he heard the bursts of\\n', 'laughter from the men over the coffee. Then he paddled out in his little red\\n', 'flannel dressing-gown and his night-suit, and took refuge by the side of his\\n', 'father, knowing that he would not be sent back. \"See the miseries of having a\\n', 'family!\" said Tods\\' father, giving Tods three prunes, some water in a glass\\n', 'that had been used for claret, and telling him to sit still. Tods sucked the\\n', 'prunes slowly, knowing that he would have to go when they were finished, and\\n', 'sipped the pink water like a man of the world, as he listened to the\\n', 'conversation. Presently, the Legal Member, talking \"shop,\" to the Head of a\\n', 'Department, mentioned his Bill by its full name--\"The Sub-Montane Tracts\\n', 'Ryotwari Revised Enactment.\" Tods caught the one native word, and lifting up\\n', 'his small voice said:--\"Oh, I know ALL about that!

What do they say, Tods?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressing-gown and said:--\"I must\\n', 'fink.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Legal Member waited patiently.

This is a\\n', 'mistake. I have seen four hundred and thirty-seven sabres flying over the face\\n', 'of the country in abject terror--have seen the best Regiment that ever drew\\n', 'bridle, wiped off the Army List for the space of two hours. If you repeat this\\n', 'tale to the White Hussars they will, in all probability, treat you severely.\\n', 'They are not proud of the incident.\\n', '\\n', 'You may know the White Hussars by their \"side,\" which is greater than that of\\n', 'all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster. If this is not a sufficient mark, you\\n', 'may know them by their old brandy. It has been sixty years in the Mess and is\\n', 'worth going far to taste.\\n', '\\n', 'Ask for the \"McGaire\" old brandy, and see that you get it. If the Mess Sergeant\\n', 'thinks that you are uneducated, and that the genuine article will be lost on\\n', 'you, he will treat you accordingly. He is a good man. But, when you are at\\n', 'Mess, you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or long-distance\\n', 'rides. The Mess are very sensitive; and, if they think that you are laughing at\\n', 'them, will tell you so.\\n', '\\n', \"As the White Hussars say, it was all the Colonel's fault. He was a new man, and\\n\", 'he ought never to have taken the Command. He said that the Regiment was not\\n', 'smart enough. This to the White Hussars, who knew they could walk round any\\n', 'Horse and through any Guns, and over any Foot on the face of the earth! That\\n', 'insult was the first cause of offence.\\n', '\\n', 'Then the Colonel cast the Drum-Horse--the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars!\\n', 'Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had committed. I will try\\n', 'to make it clear. The soul of the Regiment lives in the Drum-Horse, who carries\\n', 'the silver kettle-drums. He is nearly always a big piebald Waler. That is a\\n', 'point of honor; and a Regiment will spend anything you please on a piebald. He\\n', 'is beyond the ordinary laws of casting. His work is very light, and he only\\n', 'manoeuvres at a foot-pace. Wherefore, so long as he can step out and look\\n', 'handsome, his well-being is assured. He knows more about the Regiment than the\\n', 'Adjutant, and could not make a mistake if he tried.\\n', '\\n', 'The Drum-Horse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old, and perfectly\\n', \"equal to his duties. He had at least six years' more work in him, and carried\\n\", 'himself with all the pomp and dignity of a Drum-Major of the Guards. The\\n', 'Regiment had paid Rs. 1,200 for him.\\n', '\\n', 'But the Colonel said that he must go, and he was cast in due form and replaced\\n', 'by a washy, bay beast as ugly as a mule, with a ewe-neck, rat-tail, and cow-\\n', 'hocks. The Drummer detested that animal, and the best of the Band-horses put\\n', 'back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at the very sight of him.\\n', \"They knew him for an upstart and no gentleman. I fancy that the Colonel's ideas\\n\", 'of smartness extended to the Band, and that he wanted to make it take part in\\n', 'the regular parade movements. A Cavalry Band is a sacred thing. It only turns\\n', \"out for Commanding Officers' parades, and the Band Master is one degree more\\n\", 'important than the Colonel. He is a High Priest and the \"Keel Row\" is his holy\\n', 'song. The \"Keel Row\" is the Cavalry Trot; and the man who has never heard that\\n', 'tune rising, high and shrill, above the rattle of the Regiment going past the\\n', 'saluting-base, has something yet to hear and understand.\\n', '\\n', 'When the Colonel cast the Drum-horse of the White Hussars, there was nearly a\\n', 'mutiny.\\n', '\\n', 'The officers were angry, the Regiment were furious, and the Bandsman swore--\\n', 'like troopers. The Drum-Horse was going to be put up to auction--public\\n', 'auction--to be bought, perhaps, by a Parsee and put into a cart! It was worse\\n', 'than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the whole world, or selling the\\n', 'Mess Plate to a Jew--a black Jew.\\n', '\\n', 'The Colonel was a mean man and a bully. He knew what the Regiment thought about\\n', 'his action; and, when the troopers offered to buy the Drum-Horse, he said that\\n', 'their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the Regulations.\\n', '\\n', 'But one of the Subalterns--Hogan-Yale, an Irishman--bought the Drum-Horse for\\n', 'Rs. 160 at the sale; and the Colonel was wroth. Yale professed repentance--he\\n', 'was unnaturally submissive--and said that, as he had only made the purchase to\\n', 'save the horse from possible ill-treatment and starvation, he would now shoot\\n', 'him and end the business. This appeared to soothe the Colonel, for he wanted\\n', 'the Drum-Horse disposed of. He felt that he had made a mistake, and could not\\n', 'of course acknowledge it. Meantime, the presence of the Drum-Horse was an\\n', 'annoyance to him.\\n', '\\n', 'Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy, three cheroots, and his friend,\\n', 'Martyn; and they all left the Mess together. Yale and Martyn conferred for two\\n', \"hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier who keeps watch over Yale's\\n\", 'boot-trees knows what they said. A horse, hooded and sheeted to his ears, left\\n', \"Yale's stables and was taken, very unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's\\n\", 'groom went with him. Two men broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several\\n', 'paint-pots and some large scenery brushes. Then night fell over the\\n', 'Cantonments, and there was a noise as of a horse kicking his loose-box to\\n', \"pieces in Yale's stables. Yale had a big, old, white Waler trap-horse.\\n\", '\\n', 'The next day was a Thursday, and the men, hearing that Yale was going to shoot\\n', 'the Drum-Horse in the evening, determined to give the beast a regular\\n', 'regimental funeral--a finer one than they would have given the Colonel had he\\n', 'died just then. They got a bullock-cart and some sacking, and mounds and mounds\\n', 'of roses, and the body, under sacking, was carried out to the place where the\\n', 'anthrax cases were cremated; two-thirds of the Regiment followed. There was no\\n', 'Band, but they all sang \"The Place where the old Horse died\" as something\\n', 'respectful and appropriate to the occasion. When the corpse was dumped into the\\n', 'grave and the men began throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it, the\\n', 'Farrier-Sergeant ripped out an oath and said aloud:--\"Why, it ain\\'t the Drum-\\n', 'Horse any more than it\\'s me!\" The Troop-Sergeant-Majors asked him whether he\\n', 'had left his head in the Canteen. The Farrier-Sergeant said that he knew the\\n', \"Drum-Horse's feet as well as he knew his own; but he was silenced when he saw\\n\", 'the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff, upturned near-fore.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus was the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars buried; the Farrier-Sergeant\\n', 'grumbling. The sacking that covered the corpse was smeared in places with black\\n', 'paint; and the Farrier-Sergeant drew attention to this fact. But the Troop-\\n', 'Sergeant-Major of E Troop kicked him severely on the shin, and told him that he\\n', 'was undoubtedly drunk.\\n', '\\n', 'On the Monday following the burial, the Colonel sought revenge on the White\\n', 'Hussars. Unfortunately, being at that time temporarily in Command of the\\n', 'Station, he ordered a Brigade field-day. He said that he wished to make the\\n', 'regiment \"sweat for their damned insolence,\" and he carried out his notion\\n', 'thoroughly. That Monday was one of the hardest days in the memory of the White\\n', 'Hussars.\\n', '\\n', 'They were thrown against a skeleton-enemy, and pushed forward, and withdrawn,\\n', 'and dismounted, and \"scientifically handled\" in every possible fashion over\\n', 'dusty country, till they sweated profusely.\\n', '\\n', 'Their only amusement came late in the day, when they fell upon the battery of\\n', \"Horse Artillery and chased it for two mile's. This was a personal question, and\\n\", 'most of the troopers had money on the event; the Gunners saying openly that\\n', 'they had the legs of the White Hussars. They were wrong. A march-past concluded\\n', 'the campaign, and when the Regiment got back to their Lines, the men were\\n', 'coated with dirt from spur to chin-strap.\\n', '\\n', 'The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege. They won it at\\n', 'Fontenoy, I think.\\n', '\\n', 'Many Regiments possess special rights, such as wearing collars with undress\\n', 'uniform, or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders, or red and white roses in\\n', 'their helmets on certain days of the year. Some rights are connected with\\n', 'regimental saints, and some with regimental successes. All are valued highly;\\n', 'but none so highly as the right of the White Hussars to have the Band playing\\n', 'when their horses are being watered in the Lines. Only one tune is played, and\\n', \"that tune never varies. I don't know its real name, but the White Hussars call\\n\", 'it:--\"Take me to London again.\" It sounds very pretty. The Regiment would\\n', 'sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction.\\n', '\\n', 'After the \"dismiss\" was sounded, the officers rode off home to prepare for\\n', 'stables; and the men filed into the lines, riding easy.\\n', '\\n', 'That is to say, they opened their tight buttons, shifted their helmets, and\\n', 'began to joke or to swear as the humor took them; the more careful slipping off\\n', 'and easing girths and curbs. A good trooper values his mount exactly as much as\\n', 'he values himself, and believes, or should believe, that the two together are\\n', 'irresistible where women or men, girls or guns, are concerned.\\n', '\\n', 'Then the Orderly-Officer gave the order:--\"Water horses,\" and the Regiment\\n', 'loafed off to the squadron-troughs, which were in rear of the stables and\\n', 'between these and the barracks. There were four huge troughs, one for each\\n', 'squadron, arranged en echelon, so that the whole Regiment could water in ten\\n', 'minutes if it liked. But it lingered for seventeen, as a rule, while the Band\\n', 'played.\\n', '\\n', 'The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men slipped\\n', 'their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other.\\n', '\\n', 'The sun was just setting in a big, hot bed of red cloud, and the road to the\\n', \"Civil Lines seemed to run straight into the sun's eye.\\n\", '\\n', 'There was a little dot on the road. It grew and grew till it showed as a horse,\\n', 'with a sort of gridiron thing on his back. The red cloud glared through the\\n', 'bars of the gridiron. Some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands\\n', 'and said:--\"What the mischief as that there \\'orse got on \\'im!\"\\n', '\\n', 'In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul--horse and man--in the\\n', 'Regiment knew, and saw, heading straight towards the Band, the dead Drum-Horse\\n', 'of the White Hussars!\\n', '\\n', 'On his withers banged and bumped the kettle-drums draped in crape, and on his\\n', 'back, very stiff and soldierly, sat a bare-headed skeleton.\\n', '\\n', 'The band stopped playing, and, for a moment, there was a hush.\\n', '\\n', 'Then some one in E troop--men said it was the Troop-Sergeant-Major--swung his\\n', 'horse round and yelled. No one can account exactly for what happened\\n', 'afterwards; but it seems that, at least, one man in each troop set an example\\n', 'of panic, and the rest followed like sheep. The horses that had barely put\\n', \"their muzzles into the trough's reared and capered; but, as soon as the Band\\n\", 'broke, which it did when the ghost of the Drum-Horse was about a furlong\\n', 'distant, all hooves followed suit, and the clatter of the stampede--quite\\n', 'different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade, or the rough\\n', 'horse-play of watering in camp--made them only more terrified. They felt that\\n', 'the men on their backs were afraid of something. When horses once know THAT,\\n', 'all is over except the butchery.\\n', '\\n', 'Troop after troop turned from the troughs and ran--anywhere, and everywhere--\\n', 'like spilt quicksilver. It was a most extraordinary spectacle, for men and\\n', 'horses were in all stages of easiness, and the carbine-buckets flopping against\\n', 'their sides urged the horses on. Men were shouting and cursing, and trying to\\n', 'pull clear of the Band which was being chased by the Drum-Horse whose rider had\\n', 'fallen forward and seemed to be spurring for a wager.\\n', '\\n', 'The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink. Most of the officers were\\n', 'with him, and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down to the lines,\\n', 'and receive the watering reports from the Troop-Sergeant Majors. When \"Take me\\n', 'to London again\" stopped, after twenty bars, every one in the Mess said:--\"What\\n', 'on earth has happened?\" A minute later, they heard unmilitary noises, and saw,\\n', 'far across the plain, the White Hussars scattered, and broken, and flying.\\n', '\\n', 'The Colonel was speechless with rage, for he thought that the Regiment had\\n', 'risen against him or was unanimously drunk. The Band, a disorganized mob, tore\\n', 'past, and at its heels labored the Drum-Horse--the dead and buried Drum-Horse--\\n', 'with the jolting, clattering skeleton. Hogan-Yale whispered softly to Martyn:--\\n', '\"No wire will stand that treatment,\" and the Band, which had doubled like a\\n', 'hare, came back again. But the rest of the Regiment was gone, was rioting all\\n', 'over the Province, for the dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his\\n', 'neighbor that the Drum-Horse was on his flank.\\n', '\\n', 'Troop-Horses are far too tenderly treated as a rule. They can, on emergencies,\\n', 'do a great deal, even with seventeen stone on their backs. As the troopers\\n', 'found out.\\n', '\\n', 'How long this panic lasted I cannot say. I believe that when the moon rose the\\n', 'men saw they had nothing to fear, and, by twos and threes and half-troops,\\n', 'crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of themselves. Meantime, the\\n', 'Drum-Horse, disgusted at his treatment by old friends, pulled up, wheeled\\n', 'round, and trotted up to the Mess verandah-steps for bread. No one liked to\\n', 'run; but no one cared to go forward till the Colonel made a movement and laid\\n', \"hold of the skeleton's foot. The Band had halted some distance away, and now\\n\", 'came back slowly. The Colonel called it, individually and collectively, every\\n', 'evil name that occurred to him at the time; for he had set his hand on the\\n', 'bosom of the Drum-Horse and found flesh and blood. Then he beat the kettle-\\n', 'drums with his clenched fist, and discovered that they were but made of\\n', 'silvered paper and bamboo. Next, still swearing, he tried to drag the skeleton\\n', 'out of the saddle, but found that it had been wired into the cantle. The sight\\n', \"of the Colonel, with his arms round the skeleton's pelvis and his knee in the\\n\", \"old Drum-Horse's stomach, was striking. Not to say amusing. He worried the\\n\", 'thing off in a minute or two, and threw it down on the ground, saying to the\\n', 'Band:--\"Here, you curs, that\\'s what you\\'re afraid of.\" The skeleton did not\\n', 'look pretty in the twilight. The Band-Sergeant seemed to recognize it, for he\\n', 'began to chuckle and choke. \"Shall I take it away, sir?\" said the Band-\\n', 'Sergeant. \"Yes,\" said the Colonel, \"take it to Hell, and ride there\\n', 'yourselves!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Band-Sergeant saluted, hoisted the skeleton across his saddle-bow, and led\\n', 'off to the stables. Then the Colonel began to make inquiries for the rest of\\n', 'the Regiment, and the language he used was wonderful. He would disband the\\n', 'Regiment--he would court-martial every soul in it--he would not command such a\\n', 'set of rabble, and so on, and so on. As the men dropped in, his language grew\\n', 'wilder, until at last it exceeded the utmost limits of free speech allowed even\\n', 'to a Colonel of Horse.\\n', '\\n', 'Martyn took Hogan-Yale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the\\n', 'service as a necessity when all was discovered. Martyn was the weaker man of\\n', 'the two, Hogan-Yale put up his eyebrows and remarked, firstly, that he was the\\n', 'son of a Lord, and secondly, that he was as innocent as the babe unborn of the\\n', 'theatrical resurrection of the Drum-Horse.\\n', '\\n', '\"My instructions,\" said Yale, with a singularly sweet smile, \"were that the\\n', 'Drum-Horse should be sent back as impressively as possible.\\n', '\\n', 'I ask you, AM I responsible if a mule-headed friend sends him back in such a\\n', 'manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her Majesty\\'s Cavalry?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Martyn said:--\"you are a great man and will in time become a General; but I\\'d\\n', 'give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Providence saved Martyn and Hogan-Yale. The Second-in-Command led the Colonel\\n', 'away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of the white Hussars\\n', 'were accustomed to play poker of nights; and there, after many oaths on the\\n', \"Colonel's part, they talked together in low tones. I fancy that the Second-in-\\n\", 'Command must have represented the scare as the work of some trooper whom it\\n', 'would be hopeless to detect; and I know that he dwelt upon the sin and the\\n', 'shame of making a public laughingstock of the scare.\\n', '\\n', '\"They will call us,\" said the Second-in-Command, who had really a fine\\n', 'imagination, \"they will call us the \\'Fly-by-Nights\\'; they will call us the\\n', \"'Ghost Hunters'; they will nickname us from one end of the Army list to the\\n\", \"other. All the explanations in the world won't make outsiders understand that\\n\", 'the officers were away when the panic began. For the honor of the Regiment and\\n', 'for your own sake keep this thing quiet.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so\\n', 'difficult as might be imagined. He was made to see, gently and by degrees, that\\n', 'it was obviously impossible to court-martial the whole Regiment, and equally\\n', 'impossible to proceed against any subaltern who, in his belief, had any concern\\n', 'in the hoax.\\n', '\\n', '\"But the beast\\'s alive! He\\'s never been shot at all!\" shouted the Colonel.\\n', '\"It\\'s flat, flagrant disobedience! I\\'ve known a man broke for less, d----d\\n', 'sight less. They\\'re mocking me, I tell you, Mutman! They\\'re mocking me!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Once more, the Second-in-Command set himself to sooth the Colonel, and wrestled\\n', 'with him for half-an-hour. At the end of that time, the Regimental Sergeant-\\n', 'Major reported himself. The situation was rather novel tell to him; but he was\\n', 'not a man to be put out by circumstances. He saluted and said: \"Regiment all\\n', 'come back, Sir.\" Then, to propitiate the Colonel:--\"An\\' none of the horses any\\n', 'the worse, Sir.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Colonel only snorted and answered:--\"You\\'d better tuck the men into their\\n', 'cots, then, and see that they don\\'t wake up and cry in the night.\" The Sergeant\\n', 'withdrew.\\n', '\\n', 'His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel, and, further, he felt slightly\\n', 'ashamed of the language he had been using. The Second-in-Command worried him\\n', 'again, and the two sat talking far into the night.\\n', '\\n', \"Next day but one, there was a Commanding Officer's parade, and the Colonel\\n\", 'harangued the White Hussars vigorously. The pith of his speech was that, since\\n', 'the Drum-Horse in his old age had proved himself capable of cutting up the\\n', 'Whole Regiment, he should return to his post of pride at the head of the band,\\n', 'BUT the Regiment were a set of ruffians with bad consciences.\\n', '\\n', 'The White Hussars shouted, and threw everything movable about them into the\\n', \"air, and when the parade was over, they cheered the Colonel till they couldn't\\n\", 'speak. No cheers were put up for Lieutenant Hogan-Yale, who smiled very sweetly\\n', 'in the background.\\n', '\\n', 'Said the Second-in-Command to the Colonel, unofficially:--\"These little things\\n', 'ensure popularity, and do not the least affect discipline.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But I went back on my word,\" said the Colonel.\\n', '\\n', '\"Never mind,\" said the Second-in-Command. \"The White Hussars will follow you\\n', 'anywhere from today. Regiments are just like women. They will do anything for\\n', 'trinketry.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A week later, Hogan-Yale received an extraordinary letter from some one who\\n', 'signed himself \"Secretary Charity and Zeal, 3709, E. C.,\" and asked for \"the\\n', 'return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your possession.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones?\" said Hogan-Yale.\\n', '\\n', '\"Beg your pardon, Sir,\" said the Band-Sergeant, \"but the skeleton is with me,\\n', \"an' I'll return it if you'll pay the carriage into the Civil Lines. There's a\\n\", 'coffin with it, Sir.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Hogan-Yale smiled and handed two rupees to the Band-Sergeant, saying:--\"Write\\n', 'the date on the skull, will you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'If you doubt this story, and know where to go, you can see the date on the\\n', \"skeleton. But don't mention the matter to the White Hussars.\\n\", '\\n', 'I happen to know something about it, because I prepared the Drum-Horse for his\\n', 'resurrection.

That, however, cannot be proved.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bronckhorst was not exactly young, though fifteen years younger than her\\n', 'husband. She was a large, pale, quiet woman, with heavy eyelids, over weak\\n', 'eyes, and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it.\\n', '\\n', 'Bronckhorst was not nice in any way. He had no respect for the pretty public\\n', 'and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is. His manner\\n', 'towards his wife was coarse. There are many things--including actual assault\\n', 'with the clenched fist--that a wife will endure; but seldom a wife can bear--as\\n', 'Mrs. Bronckhorst bore--with a long course of brutal, hard chaff, making light\\n', 'of her weaknesses, her headaches, her small fits of gaiety, her dresses, her\\n', 'queer little attempts to make herself attractive to her husband when she knows\\n', 'that she is not what she has been, and--worst of all--the love that she spends\\n', 'on her children. That particular sort of heavy-handed jest was specially dear\\n', 'to Bronckhorst. I suppose that he had first slipped into it, meaning no harm,\\n', 'in the honeymoon, when folk find their ordinary stock of endearments run short,\\n', 'and so go to the other extreme to express their feelings. A similar impulse\\n', 'makes a man say:--\"Hutt, you old beast!\" when a favorite horse nuzzles his\\n', 'coat-front. Unluckily, when the reaction of marriage sets in, the form of\\n', 'speech remains, and, the tenderness having died out, hurts the wife more than\\n', 'she cares to say. But Mrs. Bronckhorst was devoted to her \"Teddy,\" as she\\n', 'called him.\\n', '\\n', 'Perhaps that was why he objected to her. Perhaps--this is only a theory to\\n', 'account for his infamous behavior later on--he gave way to the queer savage\\n', \"feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty years' married,\\n\", 'when he sees, across the table, the same face of his wedded wife, and knows\\n', 'that, as he has sat facing it, so must he continue to sit until day of its\\n', 'death or his own.\\n', '\\n', 'Most men and all women know the spasm. It only lasts for three breaths as a\\n', 'rule, must be a \"throw-back\" to times when men and women were rather worse than\\n', 'they are now, and is too unpleasant to be discussed.\\n', '\\n', \"Dinner at the Bronckhorst's was an infliction few men cared to undergo.\\n\", 'Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince. When\\n', 'their little boy came in at dessert, Bronckhorst used to give him half a glass\\n', 'of wine, and naturally enough, the poor little mite got first riotous, next\\n', 'miserable, and was removed screaming. Bronckhorst asked if that was the way\\n', 'Teddy usually behaved, and whether Mrs. Bronckhorst could not spare some of her\\n', 'time to teach the \"little beggar decency.\" Mrs. Bronckhorst, who loved the boy\\n', 'more than her own life, tried not to cry--her spirit seemed to have been broken\\n', 'by her marriage. Lastly, Bronckhorst used to say:--\"There! That\\'ll do, that\\'ll\\n', \"do. For God's sake try to behave like a rational woman. Go into the drawing-\\n\", 'room.\" Mrs. Bronckhorst would go, trying to carry it all off with a smile; and\\n', 'the guest of the evening would feel angry and uncomfortable.\\n', '\\n', 'After three years of this cheerful life--for Mrs. Bronckhorst had no woman-\\n', 'friends to talk to--the Station was startled by the news that Bronckhorst had\\n', 'instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT, against a man called Biel, who\\n', 'certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs. Bronckhorst whenever she had\\n', 'appeared in public. The utter want of reserve with which Bronckhorst treated\\n', 'his own dishonor helped us to know that the evidence against Biel would be\\n', 'entirely circumstantial and native. There were no letters; but Bronckhorst said\\n', 'openly that he would rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the\\n', 'manufacture of carpets in the Central Jail. Mrs. Bronckhorst kept entirely to\\n', 'her house, and let charitable folks say what they pleased. Opinions were\\n', 'divided. Some two-thirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion that\\n', 'Biel was guilty; but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by him. Biel was\\n', 'furious and surprised. He denied the whole thing, and vowed that he would\\n', 'thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life. No jury, we knew, could convict\\n', 'a man on the criminal count on native evidence in a land where you can buy a\\n', 'murder-charge, including the corpse, all complete for fifty-four rupees; but\\n', 'Biel did not care to scrape through by the benefit of a doubt. He wanted the\\n', 'whole thing cleared: but as he said one night:--\"He can prove anything with\\n', 'servants\\' evidence, and I\\'ve only my bare word.\" This was about a month before\\n', 'the case came on; and beyond agreeing with Biel, we could do little. All that\\n', 'we could be sure of was that the native evidence would be bad enough to blast\\n', \"Biel's character for the rest of his service; for when a native begins perjury\\n\", 'he perjures himself thoroughly. He does not boggle over details.\\n', '\\n', 'Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked over,\\n', 'said:--\"Look here! I don\\'t believe lawyers are any good. Get a man to wire to\\n', 'Strickland, and beg him to come down and pull us through.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line. He had not long\\n', 'been married to Miss Youghal, but he scented in the telegram a chance of return\\n', 'to the old detective work that his soul lusted after, and next night he came in\\n', 'and heard our story. He finished his pipe and said oracularly:--\"We must get at\\n', 'the evidence. Oorya bearer, Mussalman khit and methraniayah, I suppose, are the\\n', \"pillars of the charge.

He was a one-eyed little\\n', 'chap, not much more than five feet high, and both his middle fingers were gone.\\n', 'All the same, he was the handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen.\\n', 'Never seemed to be touched by the Smoke, either; and what he took day and\\n', \"night, night and day, was a caution. I've been at it five years, and I can do\\n\", 'my fair share of the Smoke with any one; but I was a child to Fung-Tching that\\n', \"way. All the same, the old man was keen on his money, very keen; and that's\\n\", \"what I can't understand. I heard he saved a good deal before he died, but his\\n\", \"nephew has got all that now; and the old man's gone back to China to be buried.\\n\", '\\n', 'He kept the big upper room, where his best customers gathered, as neat as a new\\n', \"pin. In one corner used to stand Fung-Tching's Joss--almost as ugly as Fung-\\n\", 'Tching--and there were always sticks burning under his nose; but you never\\n', \"smelt 'em when the pipes were going thick. Opposite the Joss was Fung-Tching's\\n\", 'coffin. He had spent a good deal of his savings on that, and whenever a new man\\n', 'came to the Gate he was always introduced to it.

I don't know whether that's true or not, but I know that,\\n\", 'if I came first in the evening, I used to spread my mat just at the foot of it.\\n', 'It was a quiet corner you see, and a sort of breeze from the gully came in at\\n', 'the window now and then. Besides the mats, there was no other furniture in the\\n', 'room--only the coffin, and the old Joss all green and blue and purple with age\\n', 'and polish.\\n', '\\n', 'Fung-Tching never told us why he called the place \"The Gate of a Hundred\\n', 'Sorrows.\" (He was the only Chinaman I know who used bad-sounding fancy names.\\n', \"Most of them are flowery.

Now, I was one of that sort when I began, but I've been at\\n\", 'it for five years pretty steadily, and its different now. There was an old aunt\\n', 'of mine, down Agra way, and she left me a little at her death. About sixty\\n', \"rupees a month secured. Sixty isn't much.

The Black Smoke does not allow of much\\n\", 'other business; and even though I am very little affected by it, as men go, I\\n', \"couldn't do a day's work now to save my life. After all, sixty rupees is what I\\n\", 'want. When old Fung-Tching was alive he used to draw the money for me, give me\\n', 'about half of it to live on (I eat very little), and the rest he kept himself.\\n', 'I was free of the Gate at any time of the day and night, and could smoke and\\n', \"sleep there when I liked, so I didn't care. I know the old man made a good\\n\", \"thing out of it; but that's no matter. Nothing matters, much to me; and,\\n\", 'besides, the money always came fresh and fresh each month.\\n', '\\n', 'There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened. Me, and\\n', 'two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli, but they got the\\n', \"sack and couldn't pay (no man who has to work in the daylight can do the Black\\n\", \"Smoke for any length of time straight on); a Chinaman that was Fung-Tching's\\n\", 'nephew; a bazar-woman that had got a lot of money somehow; an English loafer--\\n', 'Mac-Somebody I think, but I have forgotten--that smoked heaps, but never seemed\\n', \"to pay anything (they said he had saved Fung-Tching's life at some trial in\\n\", 'Calcutta when he was a barrister): another Eurasian, like myself, from Madras;\\n', 'a half-caste woman, and a couple of men who said they had come from the North.\\n', 'I think they must have been Persians or Afghans or something. There are not\\n', \"more than five of us living now, but we come regular. I don't know what\\n\", 'happened to the Baboos; but the bazar-woman she died after six months of the\\n', 'Gate, and I think Fung-Tching took her bangles and nose-ring for himself. But\\n', \"I'm not certain. The Englishman, he drank as well as smoked, and he dropped\\n\", 'off.

So, you see, there is only me, the\\n', 'Chinaman, the half-caste woman that we call the Memsahib (she used to live with\\n', 'Fung-Tching), the other Eurasian, and one of the Persians. The Memsahib looks\\n', 'very old now. I think she was a young woman when the Gate was opened; but we\\n', 'are all old for the matter of that. Hundreds and hundreds of years old.

Before that, I\\n', 'think, I used a big bamboo stem with a copper cup, a very small one, and a\\n', 'green jade mouthpiece.

He wanted to be deceived, he meant to be deceived, and he\\n', 'deceived himself very thoroughly. Not only were the face and figure, the face\\n', 'and figure of Alice Chisane, but the voice and lower tones were exactly the\\n', 'same, and so were the turns of speech; and the little mannerisms, that every\\n', 'woman has, of gait and gesticulation, were absolutely and identically the same.\\n', 'The turn of the head was the same; the tired look in the eyes at the end of a\\n', 'long walk was the same; the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a\\n', 'pulling horse was the same; and once, most marvellous of all, Mrs. Landys-\\n', 'Haggert singing to herself in the next room, while Hannasyde was waiting to\\n', 'take her for a ride, hummed, note for note, with a throaty quiver of the voice\\n', 'in the second line:--\"Poor Wandering One!\" exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed\\n', 'it for Hannasyde in the dusk of an English drawing-room.

These two\\n', 'little people retired from the world after their marriage, and were very happy.\\n', 'They were forced, of course, to give occasional dinners, but they made no\\n', 'friends hereby, and the Station went its own way and forgot them; only saying,\\n', 'occasionally, that Dormouse was the best of good fellows, though dull.

Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world for a year, and\\n', 'he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid broke out in the Station\\n', 'in the heart of the cold weather, and his wife went down. He was a shy little\\n', 'man, and five days were wasted before he realized that Mrs. Dumoise was burning\\n', 'with something worse than simple fever, and three days more passed before he\\n', \"ventured to call on Mrs. Shute, the Engineer's wife, and timidly speak about\\n\", 'his trouble. Nearly every household in India knows that Doctors are very\\n', 'helpless in typhoid. The battle must be fought out between Death and the\\n', 'Nurses, minute by minute and degree by degree. Mrs. Shute almost boxed\\n', 'Dumoise\\'s ears for what she called his \"criminal delay,\" and went off at once\\n', 'to look after the poor girl. We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station that\\n', 'winter and, as the average of death is about one in every five cases, we felt\\n', 'certain that we should have to lose somebody. But all did their best. The women\\n', 'sat up nursing the women, and the men turned to and tended the bachelors who\\n', 'were down, and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for fifty-six days, and\\n', 'brought them through the Valley of the Shadow in triumph. But, just when we\\n', 'thought all was over, and were going to give a dance to celebrate the victory,\\n', 'little Mrs. Dumoise got a relapse and died in a week and the Station went to\\n', 'the funeral. Dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave, and had to\\n', 'be taken away.\\n', '\\n', 'After the death, Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be comforted.\\n', 'He did his duties perfectly, but we all felt that he should go on leave, and\\n', 'the other men of his own Service told him so. Dumoise was very thankful for the\\n', 'suggestion--he was thankful for anything in those days--and went to Chini on a\\n', 'walking-tour.\\n', '\\n', 'Chini is some twenty marches from Simla, in the heart of the Hills, and the\\n', 'scenery is good if you are in trouble.

He took also a\\n', \"useless bearer, because the man had been his wife's favorite servant. He was\\n\", 'idle and a thief, but Dumoise trusted everything to him.\\n', '\\n', 'On his way back from Chini, Dumoise turned aside to Bagi, through the Forest\\n', 'Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo.

It runs through dark wet forest, and ends suddenly in bleak, nipped\\n', 'hill-side and black rocks. Bagi dak-bungalow is open to all the winds and is\\n', 'bitterly cold. Few people go to Bagi.

It must be more than twelve hundred miles from Meridki.\\n', '\\n', 'Dumoise went through Simla without halting, and returned to Meridki there to\\n', 'take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during his tour.\\n', 'There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained, and some recent orders of\\n', 'the Surgeon-General to be noted, and, altogether, the taking-over was a full\\n', \"day's work. In the evening, Dumoise told his locum tenens, who was an old\\n\", 'friend of his bachelor days, what had happened at Bagi; and the man said that\\n', 'Ram Dass might as well have chosen Tuticorin while he was about it.\\n', '\\n', 'At that moment a telegraph-peon came in with a telegram from Simla, ordering\\n', 'Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki, but to go at once to Nuddea on\\n', 'special duty. There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at Nuddea, and the Bengal\\n', 'Government, being shorthanded, as usual, had borrowed a Surgeon from the\\n', 'Punjab.\\n', '\\n', 'Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and said:--\"Well?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The other Doctor said nothing. It was all that he could say.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way from Bagi;\\n', 'and thus might, possibly, have heard the first news of the impending transfer.\\n', '\\n', 'He tried to put the question, and the implied suspicion into words, but Dumoise\\n', 'stopped him with:--\"If I had desired THAT, I should never have come back from\\n', 'Chini. I was shooting there. I wish to live, for I have things to do . . . .\\n', 'but I shall not be sorry.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The other man bowed his head, and helped, in the twilight, to pack up Dumoise's\\n\", 'just opened trunks. Ram Dass entered with the lamps.\\n', '\\n', '\"Where is the Sahib going?\" he asked.\\n', '\\n', '\"To Nuddea,\" said Dumoise, softly.\\n', '\\n', \"Ram Dass clawed Dumoise's knees and boots and begged him not to go.\\n\", '\\n', 'Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room.

O Moon and little, little Stars! To think that a\\n', 'man should so shamelessly . . . . Infamous liquor, too. Ovid in exile drank no\\n', 'worse. Better. It was frozen. Alas! I had no ice. Good night. I would introduce\\n', 'you to my wife were I sober--or she civilized.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A native woman came out of the darkness of the room, and began calling the man\\n', 'names; so I went away. He was the most interesting loafer that I had the\\n', 'pleasure of knowing for a long time; and later on, he became a friend of mine.\\n', 'He was a tall, well-built, fair man fearfully shaken with drink, and he looked\\n', 'nearer fifty than the thirty-five which, he said, was his real age. When a man\\n', 'begins to sink in India, and is not sent Home by his friends as soon as may be,\\n', 'he falls very low from a respectable point of view. By the time that he changes\\n', 'his creed, as did McIntosh, he is past redemption.\\n', '\\n', 'In most big cities, natives will tell you of two or three Sahibs, generally\\n', 'low-caste, who have turned Hindu or Mussulman, and who live more or less as\\n', 'such. But it is not often that you can get to know them. As McIntosh himself\\n', 'used to say:--\"If I change my religion for my stomach\\'s sake, I do not seek to\\n', 'become a martyr to missionaries, nor am I anxious for notoriety.\"\\n', '\\n', 'At the outset of acquaintance McIntosh warned me. \"Remember this. I am not an\\n', 'object for charity. I require neither your money, your food, nor your cast-off\\n', 'raiment. I am that rare animal, a self-supporting drunkard. If you choose, I\\n', 'will smoke with you, for the tobacco of the bazars does not, I admit, suit my\\n', 'palate; and I will borrow any books which you may not specially value. It is\\n', 'more than likely that I shall sell them for bottles of excessively filthy\\n', 'country-liquors. In return, you shall share such hospitality as my house\\n', 'affords. Here is a charpoy on which two can sit, and it is possible that there\\n', 'may, from time to time, be food in that platter. Drink, unfortunately, you will\\n', 'find on the premises at any hour: and thus I make you welcome to all my poor\\n', 'establishments.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was admitted to the McIntosh household--I and my good tobacco.\\n', '\\n', 'But nothing else. Unluckily, one cannot visit a loafer in the Serai by day.\\n', 'Friends buying horses would not understand it.\\n', '\\n', 'Consequently, I was obliged to see McIntosh after dark. He laughed at this, and\\n', 'said simply:--\"You are perfectly right. When I enjoyed a position in society,\\n', 'rather higher than yours, I should have done exactly the same thing, Good\\n', 'Heavens! I was once\"--he spoke as though he had fallen from the Command of a\\n', 'Regiment--\"an Oxford Man!\" This accounted for the reference to Charley Symonds\\'\\n', 'stable.\\n', '\\n', '\"You,\" said McIntosh, slowly, \"have not had that advantage; but, to outward\\n', 'appearance, you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong drinks. On the\\n', 'whole, I fancy that you are the luckier of the two. Yet I am not certain. You\\n', 'are--forgive my saying so even while I am smoking your excellent tobacco--\\n', 'painfully ignorant of many things.\"\\n', '\\n', 'We were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead, for he owned no chairs,\\n', 'watching the horses being watered for the night, while the native woman was\\n', 'preparing dinner. I did not like being patronized by a loafer, but I was his\\n', 'guest for the time being, though he owned only one very torn alpaca-coat and a\\n', 'pair of trousers made out of gunny-bags. He took the pipe out of his mouth, and\\n', 'went on judicially:--\"All things considered, I doubt whether you are the\\n', 'luckier. I do not refer to your extremely limited classical attainments, or\\n', 'your excruciating quantities, but to your gross ignorance of matters more\\n', 'immediately under your notice. That for instance.\"--He pointed to a woman\\n', 'cleaning a samovar near the well in the centre of the Serai. She was flicking\\n', 'the water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks.\\n', '\\n', '\"There are ways and ways of cleaning samovars. If you knew why she was doing\\n', 'her work in that particular fashion, you would know what the Spanish Monk meant\\n', 'when he said--\\n', '\\n', \"   'I the Trinity illustrate,\\n\", '     Drinking watered orange-pulp--\\n', '   In three sips the Aryan frustrate,\\n', \"     While he drains his at one gulp.--'\\n\", '\\n', 'and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes. However, Mrs.\\n', 'McIntosh has prepared dinner. Let us come and eat after the fashion of the\\n', 'people of the country--of whom, by the way, you know nothing.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us. This was wrong. The wife\\n', 'should always wait until the husband has eaten.\\n', '\\n', 'McIntosh Jellaludin apologized, saying:--\\n', '\\n', '\"It is an English prejudice which I have not been able to overcome; and she\\n', 'loves me.

I\\n', 'believe her to be moral, and know her to be skilled in cookery.\"\\n', '\\n', \"He patted the woman's head as he spoke, and she cooed softly. She was not\\n\", 'pretty to look at.\\n', '\\n', 'McIntosh never told me what position he had held before his fall.\\n', '\\n', 'He was, when sober, a scholar and a gentleman. When drunk, he was rather more\\n', 'of the first than the second. He used to get drunk about once a week for two\\n', 'days. On those occasions the native woman tended him while he raved in all\\n', 'tongues except his own. One day, indeed, he began reciting Atalanta in Calydon,\\n', 'and went through it to the end, beating time to the swing of the verse with a\\n', \"bedstead-leg. But he did most of his ravings in Greek or German. The man's mind\\n\", 'was a perfect rag-bag of useless things. Once, when he was beginning to get\\n', 'sober, he told me that I was the only rational being in the Inferno into which\\n', 'he had descended--a Virgil in the Shades, he said--and that, in return for my\\n', 'tobacco, he would, before he died, give me the materials of a new Inferno that\\n', 'should make me greater than Dante. Then he fell asleep on a horse-blanket and\\n', 'woke up quite calm.\\n', '\\n', '\"Man,\" said he, \"when you have reached the uttermost depths of degradation,\\n', 'little incidents which would vex a higher life, are to you of no consequence.\\n', 'Last night, my soul was among the gods; but I make no doubt that my bestial\\n', 'body was writhing down here in the garbage.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You were abominably drunk if that\\'s what you mean,\" I said.\\n', '\\n', '\"I WAS drunk--filthy drunk.

Now, in a higher life, how ghastly would have been my\\n', 'punishment, how bitter my repentance! Believe me, my friend with the neglected\\n', 'education, the highest is as the lowest--always supposing each degree extreme.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He turned round on the blanket, put his head between his fists and continued:--\\n', '\\n', '\"On the Soul which I have lost and on the Conscience which I have killed, I\\n', 'tell you that I CANNOT feel!

Is this enviable or is it not?\"\\n', '\\n', 'When a man has lost the warning of \"next morning\\'s head,\" he must be in a bad\\n', 'state, I answered, looking at McIntosh on the blanket, with his hair over his\\n', 'eyes and his lips blue-white, that I did not think the insensibility good\\n', 'enough.\\n', '\\n', '\"For pity\\'s sake, don\\'t say that! I tell you, it IS good and most enviable.\\n', 'Think of my consolations!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Have you so many, then, McIntosh?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly; your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon of a\\n', 'cultured man, are crude. First, my attainments, my classical and literary\\n', 'knowledge, blurred, perhaps, by immoderate drinking--which reminds me that\\n', 'before my soul went to the Gods last night, I sold the Pickering Horace you so\\n', 'kindly lent me. Ditta Mull the Clothesman has it. It fetched ten annas, and may\\n', 'be redeemed for a rupee--but still infinitely superior to yours. Secondly, the\\n', 'abiding affection of Mrs. McIntosh, best of wives. Thirdly, a monument, more\\n', 'enduring than brass, which I have built up in the seven years of my\\n', 'degradation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He stopped here, and crawled across the room for a drink of water.\\n', '\\n', 'He was very shaky and sick.\\n', '\\n', 'He referred several times to his \"treasure\"--some great possession that he\\n', 'owned--but I held this to be the raving of drink. He was as poor and as proud\\n', 'as he could be. His manner was not pleasant, but he knew enough about the\\n', 'natives, among whom seven years of his life had been spent, to make his\\n', 'acquaintance worth having. He used actually to laugh at Strickland as an\\n', 'ignorant man--\"ignorant West and East\"--he said. His boast was, first, that he\\n', 'was an Oxford Man of rare and shining parts, which may or may not have been\\n', 'true--I did not know enough to check his statements--and, secondly, that he\\n', '\"had his hand on the pulse of native life\"--which was a fact. As an Oxford man,\\n', 'he struck me as a prig: he was always throwing his education about. As a\\n', 'Mahommedan faquir--as McIntosh Jellaludin--he was all that I wanted for my own\\n', 'ends. He smoked several pounds of my tobacco, and taught me several ounces of\\n', 'things worth knowing; but he would never accept any gifts, not even when the\\n', 'cold weather came, and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin alpaca-\\n', 'coat. He grew very angry, and said that I had insulted him, and that he was not\\n', 'going into hospital. He had lived like a beast and he would die rationally,\\n', 'like a man.\\n', '\\n', 'As a matter of fact, he died of pneumonia; and on the night of his death sent\\n', 'over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die.\\n', '\\n', 'The native woman was weeping by the side of the bed. McIntosh, wrapped in a\\n', 'cotton cloth, was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over him. He was\\n', 'very active as far as his mind was concerned, and his eyes were blazing. When\\n', 'he had abused the Doctor who came with me so foully that the indignant old\\n', 'fellow left, he cursed me for a few minutes and calmed down.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he told his wife to fetch out \"The Book\" from a hole in the wall. She\\n', 'brought out a big bundle, wrapped in the tail of a petticoat, of old sheets of\\n', 'miscellaneous note-paper, all numbered and covered with fine cramped writing.\\n', 'McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and stirred it up lovingly.\\n', '\\n', '\"This,\" he said, \"is my work--the Book of McIntosh Jellaludin, showing what he\\n', 'saw and how he lived, and what befell him and others; being also an account of\\n', \"the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin.

The papers did not look specially valuable; but McIntosh\\n', 'handled them as if they were currency-notes.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he said slowly:--\"In despite the many weaknesses of your education, you\\n', 'have been good to me. I will speak of your tobacco when I reach the Gods. I owe\\n', 'you much thanks for many kindnesses.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I abominate indebtedness.

I am neither mad nor drunk!\\n', 'That book will make you famous.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I said, \"thank you,\" as the native woman put the bundle into my arms.\\n', '\\n', '\"My only baby!\" said McIntosh with a smile. He was sinking fast, but he\\n', 'continued to talk as long as breath remained. I waited for the end: knowing\\n', 'that, in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his mother.

We oughtn\\'t to have it, you\\n', 'know,\" said Maisie.\\n', '\\n', '\"Beat me, and lock you up in your bedroom,\" Dick answered, without  hesitation.\\n', '\"Have you got the cartridges?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; they\"re in my pocket, but they are joggling horribly. Do pin-fire \\n', 'cartridges go off of their own accord?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t know. Take the revolver, if you are afraid, and let me carry them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m not afraid.\" Maisie strode forward swiftly, a hand in her pocket  and her\\n', 'chin in the air. Dick followed with a small pin-fire revolver.\\n', '\\n', 'The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without\\n', 'pistol-practice. After much forethought and self-denial, Dick had saved seven\\n', 'shillings and sixpence, the price of a badly constructed Belgian revolver.\\n', 'Maisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for the purchase of\\n', 'a hundred cartridges. \"You can save better than I can, Dick,\" she explained; \"I\\n', \"like nice things to eat, and it doesn't matter to you. Besides, boys ought to\\n\", 'do these things.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement, but went out and made the purchase,\\n', 'which the children were then on their way to test. Revolvers did not lie in the\\n', 'scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the guardian who was\\n', 'incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to these two orphans.\\n', 'Dick had been under her care for six years, during which time she had made her\\n', 'profit of the allowances supposed to be expended on his clothes, and, partly\\n', 'through thoughtlessness, partly through a natural desire to pain,--she was a\\n', 'widow of some years anxious to marry again,--had made his days burdensome on\\n', 'his young shoulders.\\n', '\\n', 'Where he had looked for love, she gave him first aversion and then hate.\\n', '\\n', 'Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy, she gave him ridicule. The\\n', 'many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her small house she\\n', 'devoted to what she called the home-training of Dick Heldar. Her religion,\\n', 'manufactured in the main by her own intelligence and a keen study of the\\n', 'Scriptures, was an aid to her in this matter. At such times as she herself was\\n', 'not personally displeased with Dick, she left him to understand that he had a\\n', 'heavy account to settle with his Creator; wherefore Dick learned to loathe his\\n', 'God as intensely as he loathed Mrs. Jennett; and this is not a wholesome frame\\n', 'of mind for the young. Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar, when\\n', 'dread of pain drove him to his first untruth he naturally developed into a\\n', 'liar, but an economical and self-contained one, never throwing away the least\\n', 'unnecessary fib, and never hesitating at the blackest, were it only plausible,\\n', 'that might make his life a little easier. The treatment taught him at least the\\n', 'power of living alone,--a power that was of service to him when he went to a\\n', 'public school and the boys laughed at his clothes, which were poor in quality\\n', 'and much mended. In the holidays he returned to the teachings of Mrs. Jennett,\\n', 'and, that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the\\n', 'world, was generally beaten, on one account or another, before he had been\\n', 'twelve hours under her roof.\\n', '\\n', 'The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage, a long-haired, gray-\\n', 'eyed little atom, as self-contained as himself, who moved about the house\\n', 'silently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was her\\n', 'chiefest friend on earth and lived in the back-garden. Mrs. Jennett objected to\\n', 'the goat on the grounds that he was un-Christian,--which he certainly was.\\n', '\"Then,\" said the atom, choosing her words very deliberately, \"I shall write to\\n', 'my lawyer-peoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman. Amomma is mine,\\n', 'mine, mine!\" Mrs. Jennett made a movement to the hall, where certain umbrellas\\n', 'and canes stood in a rack. The atom understood as clearly as Dick what this\\n', 'meant. \"I have been beaten before,\" she said, still in the same passionless\\n', 'voice; \"I have been beaten worse than you can ever beat me. If you beat me I\\n', 'shall write to my lawyer-peoples and tell them that you do not give me enough\\n', 'to eat. I am not afraid of you.\" Mrs. Jennett did not go into the hall, and the\\n', 'atom, after a pause to assure herself that all danger of war was past, went\\n', 'out, to weep bitterly on Amomma\"s neck.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick learned to know her as Maisie, and at first mistrusted her profoundly, for\\n', 'he feared that she might interfere with the small liberty of action left to\\n', 'him. She did not, however; and she volunteered no friendliness until Dick had\\n', 'taken the first steps. Long before the holidays were over, the stress of\\n', 'punishment shared in common drove the children together, if it were only to\\n', 'play into each other\\'s hands as they prepared lies for Mrs. Jennett\"s use. When\\n', 'Dick returned to school, Maisie whispered, \"Now I shall be all alone to take\\n', 'care of myself; but,\" and she nodded her head bravely, \"I can do it. You\\n', 'promised to send Amomma a grass collar. Send it soon.\" A week later she asked\\n', 'for that collar by return of post, and was not pleased when she learned that it\\n', 'took time to make. When at last Dick forwarded the gift, she forgot to thank\\n', 'him for it.\\n', '\\n', 'Many holidays had come and gone since that day, and Dick had grown into a lanky\\n', 'hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes. Not for a moment had\\n', 'Mrs. Jennett relaxed her tender care of him, but the average canings of a\\n', 'public school--Dick fell under punishment about three times a month--filled him\\n', 'with contempt for her powers. \"She doesn\\'t hurt,\" he explained to Maisie, who\\n', 'urged him to rebellion, \"and she is kinder to you after she has whacked me.\"\\n', 'Dick shambled through the days unkempt in body and savage in soul, as the\\n', 'smaller boys of the school learned to know, for when the spirit moved him he\\n', 'would hit them, cunningly and with science. The same spirit made him more than\\n', 'once try to tease Maisie, but the girl refused to be made unhappy. \"We are both\\n', 'miserable as it is,\" said she. \"What is the use of trying to make things worse?\\n', 'Let\\'s find things to do, and forget things.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The pistol was the outcome of that search. It could only be used on the\\n', 'muddiest foreshore of the beach, far away from the bathing-machines and\\n', 'pierheads, below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out nearly two\\n', 'miles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks, touched by the sun, sent\\n', 'up a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was late in the afternoon when Dick and\\n', 'Maisie arrived on their ground, Amomma trotting patiently behind them.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mf!\" said Maisie, sniffing the air. \"I wonder what makes the sea so smelly? I\\n', 'don\\'tlike it!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You never like anything that isn\\'t made just for you,\" said Dick bluntly.\\n', '\"Give me the cartridges, and I\\'ll try first shot. How far does one of these\\n', 'little revolvers carry?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, half a mile,\" said Maisie, promptly. \"At least it makes an awful noise. Be\\n', \"careful with the cartridges; I don't like those jagged stick-up things on the\\n\", 'rim. Dick, do be careful.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All right. I know how to load. I\\'ll fire at the breakwater out there.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He fired, and Amomma ran away bleating. The bullet threw up a spurt of mud to\\n', 'the right of the wood-wreathed piles.\\n', '\\n', '\"Throws high and to the right. You try, Maisie. Mind, it\\'s loaded all round.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud, her hand\\n', 'firmly closed on the butt, her mouth and left eye screwed up.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma returned very cautiously.\\n', 'He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks, and, finding\\n', 'the cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations with his nose. Maisie fired,\\n', 'but could not see where the bullet went.\\n', '\\n', '\"I think it hit the post,\" she said, shading her eyes and looking out across\\n', 'the sailless sea.\\n', '\\n', '\"I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell-buoy,\" said Dick, with a chuckle.\\n', '\"Fire low and to the left; then perhaps you\"ll get it. Oh, look at Amomma!--\\n', 'he\"s eating the cartridges!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie turned, the revolver in her hand, just in time to see Amomma scampering\\n', 'away from the pebbles Dick threw after him. Nothing is sacred to a billy-goat.\\n', 'Being well fed and the adored of his mistress, Amomma had naturally swallowed\\n', 'two loaded pin-fire cartridges. Maisie hurried up to assure herself that Dick\\n', 'had not miscounted the tale.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, he\\'s eaten two.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Horrid little beast! Then they\\'ll joggle about inside him and blow up, and\\n', 'serve him right. . . . Oh, Dick! have I killed you?\"\\n', '\\n', ' Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with. Maisie could not\\n', 'explain how it had happened, but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from\\n', 'Dick, and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face. Then\\n', 'she heard him sputter, and dropped on her knees beside him, crying, \"Dick, you\\n', 'aren\\'t hurt, are you? I didn\\'t mean it.\"\\n', '\\n', ' \"Of course you didn\\'t, said Dick, coming out of the smoke and wiping his\\n', 'cheek. \"But you nearly blinded me. That powder stuff stings awfully.\" A neat\\n', 'little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had gone. Maisie\\n', 'began to whimper.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t,\" said Dick, jumping to his feet and shaking himself. \"I\\'m not a bit\\n', 'hurt.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, but I might have killed you,\" protested Maisie, the corners of her mouth\\n', 'drooping. \"What should I have done then?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Gone home and told Mrs. Jennett.\" Dick grinned at the thought; then,\\n', 'softening, \"Please don\\'tworry about it. Besides, we are wasting time. We\\'ve got\\n', 'to get back to tea. I\\'ll take the revolver for a bit.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's indifference,\\n\", 'albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol, restrained her. She lay\\n', 'panting on the beach while Dick methodically bombarded the breakwater. \"Got it\\n', 'at last!\" he exclaimed, as a lock of weed flew from the wood.\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me try,\" said Maisie, imperiously. \"I\\'m all right now.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself to\\n', 'pieces, and Amomma the outcast--because he might blow up at any moment--browsed\\n', 'in the background and wondered why stones were thrown at him. Then they found a\\n', 'balk of timber floating in a pool which was commanded by the seaward slope of\\n', 'Fort Keeling, and they sat down together before this new target.\\n', '\\n', '\"Next holidays,\" said Dick, as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked wildly\\n', 'in his hand, \"we\\'ll get another pistol,--central fire,--that will carry\\n', 'farther.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There won\\'tbe any next holidays for me,\" said Maisie. \"I\\'m going away.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Where to?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know. My lawyers have written to Mrs. Jennett, and I\\'ve got to be\\n', \"educated somewhere,--in France, perhaps,--I don'tknow where; but I shall be\\n\", 'glad to go away.\"\\n', '\\n', ' \"I shan\\'t like it a bit. I suppose I shall be left. Look here, Maisie, is it\\n', \"really true you're going? Then these holidays will be the last I shall see\\n\", 'anything of you; and I go back to school next week.

Because you\\'re going away from Mrs. Jennett?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"From me, then?\"\\n', '\\n', 'No answer for a long time. Dick dared not look at her. He felt, though he did\\n', 'not know, all that the past four years had been to him, and this the more\\n', 'acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"I suppose it is.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Maisie, you must know. I\\'m not supposing.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let\\'s go home,\" said Maisie, weakly.\\n', '\\n', 'But Dick was not minded to retreat.\\n', '\\n', '\"I can\\'t say things,\" he pleaded, \"and I\\'m awfully sorry for teasing you about\\n', \"Amomma the other day. It's all different now, Maisie, can't you see? And you\\n\", 'might have told me that you were going, instead of leaving me to find out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You didn\\'t. I did tell. Oh, Dick, what\\'s the use of worrying?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There isn\\'t any; but we\\'ve been together years and years, and I didn\\'t know\\n', 'how much I cared.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t believe you ever did care.\"\\n', '\\n', ' \"No, I didn\\'t; but I do,--I care awfully now, Maisie,\" he gulped,--\"Maisie,\\n', 'darling, say you care too, please.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do, indeed I do; but it won\\'t be any use.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Because I am going away.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, but if you promise before you go. Only say--will you?\" A second \"darling\"\\n', 'came to his lips more easily than the first. There were few endearments in\\n', \"Dick's home or school life; he had to find them by instinct.

Please don\\'t! It was all right when we said good-morning; but\\n', 'now it\\'s all different!\" Amomma looked on from afar.\\n', '\\n', 'He had seen his property quarrel frequently, but he had never seen kisses\\n', 'exchanged before. The yellow sea-poppy was wiser, and nodded its head\\n', 'approvingly. Considered as a kiss, that was a failure, but since it was the\\n', 'first, other than those demanded by duty, in all the world that either had ever\\n', 'given or taken, it opened to them new worlds, and every one of them glorious,\\n', 'so that they were lifted above the consideration of any worlds at all,\\n', \"especially those in which tea is necessary, and sat still, holding each other's\\n\", 'hands and saying not a word.\\n', '\\n', '\"You can\\'t  forget now,\" said Dick, at last. There was that on his cheek that\\n', 'stung more than gunpowder.\\n', '\\n', '\"I shouldn\\'t  have forgotten anyhow,\" said Maisie, and they looked at each\\n', 'other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour ago to a\\n', 'wonder and a mystery they could not understand. The sun began to set, and a\\n', 'night-wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore.\\n', '\\n', '\"We shall be awfully late for tea,\" said Maisie. \"Let\\'s go home.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let\\'s use the rest of the cartridges first,\" said Dick; and he helped Maisie\\n', 'down the slope of the fort to the sea,--a descent that she was quite capable of\\n', 'covering at full speed. Equally gravely Maisie took the grimy hand. Dick bent\\n', 'forward clumsily; Maisie drew the hand away, and Dick blushed.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s very pretty,\" he said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Pooh!\" said Maisie, with a little laugh of gratified vanity. She stood close\\n', 'to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over the sea with\\n', 'a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting Maisie from all\\n', 'the evils in the world. A puddle far across the mud caught the last rays of the\\n', \"sun and turned into a wrathful red disc. The light held Dick's attention for a\\n\", 'moment, and as he raised his revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of\\n', 'the miraculous, in that he was standing by Maisie who had promised to care for\\n', 'him for an indefinite length of time till such date as----A gust of the growing\\n', 'wind drove the girl\"s long black hair across his face as she stood with her\\n', 'hand on his shoulder calling Amomma \"a little beast,\" and for a moment he was\\n', 'in the dark,--a darkness that stung. The bullet went singing out to the empty\\n', 'sea.\\n', '\\n', '\"Spoilt my aim,\" said he, shaking his head. \"There aren\\'t  any more cartridges;\\n', 'we shall have to run home.\" But they did not run. They walked very slowly, arm\\n', 'in arm. And it was a matter of indifference to them whether the neglected\\n', 'Amomma with two pin-fire cartridges in his inside blew up or trotted beside\\n', 'them; for they had come into a golden heritage and were disposing of it with\\n', 'all the wisdom of all their years.\\n', '\\n', '\"And I shall be----\" quoth Dick, valiantly. Then he checked himself: \"I don\\'t \\n', \"know what I shall be. I don't  seem to be able to pass any exams, but I can\\n\", 'make awful caricatures of the masters. Ho! Ho!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Be an artist, then,\" said Maisie. \"You\\'re always laughing at my trying to\\n', 'draw; and it will do you good.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ll never laugh at anything you do,\" he answered. \"I\\'ll be an artist, and\\n', 'I\\'ll do things.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Artists always want money, don\\'tthey?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own.

The indescribable scent of Nile mud in the air told that\\n', 'the stream was falling and the next few miles would be no light thing for the\\n', 'whale-boats to overpass. The desert ran down almost to the banks, where, among\\n', 'gray, red, and black hillocks, a camel-corps was encamped. No man dared even\\n', 'for a day lose touch of the slow-moving boats; there had been no fighting for\\n', 'weeks past, and throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them. Rapid\\n', 'had followed rapid, rock rock, and island-group island-group, till the rank and\\n', 'file had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of time. They\\n', 'were moving somewhere, they did not know why, to do something, they did not\\n', 'know what. Before them lay the Nile, and at the other end of it was one Gordon,\\n', 'fighting for the dear life, in a town called Khartoum. There were columns of\\n', 'British troops in the desert, or in one of the many deserts; there were yet\\n', 'more columns waiting to embark on the river; there were fresh drafts waiting at\\n', 'Assioot and Assuan; there were lies and rumours running over the face of the\\n', 'hopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract, and men supposed generally\\n', 'that there must be some one in authority to direct the general scheme of the\\n', 'many movements. The duty of that particular river-column was to keep the whale-\\n', \"boats afloat in the water, to avoid trampling on the villagers' crops when the\\n\", 'gangs \"tracked\" the boats with lines thrown from midstream, to get as much\\n', 'sleep and food as was possible, and, above all, to press on without delay in\\n', 'the teeth of the churning Nile.\\n', '\\n', 'With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers, and\\n', 'they were almost as ignorant as their companions.

He represented the Central Southern Syndicate in the\\n', 'campaign, as he had represented it in the Egyptian war, and elsewhere.

It supplied the masses, and all it demanded was picturesqueness and\\n', 'abundance of detail; for there is more joy in England over a soldier who\\n', 'insubordinately steps out of square to rescue a comrade than over twenty\\n', 'generals slaving even to baldness at the gross details of transport and\\n', 'commissariat.\\n', '\\n', 'He had met at Suakin a young man, sitting on the edge of a recently abandoned\\n', 'redoubt about the size of a hat-box, sketching a clump of shell-torn bodies on\\n', 'the gravel plain.\\n', '\\n', '\"What are you for?\" said Torpenhow. The greeting of the correspondent is that\\n', 'of the commercial traveller on the road.\\n', '\\n', '\"My own hand,\" said the young man, without looking up. \"Have you any tobacco?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished, and when he had looked at it\\n', 'said, \"What\\'s your business here?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing; there was a row, so I came.

It was Dick who managed to make gloriously drunk a telegraph-clerk in\\n', 'a palm hut far beyond the Second Cataract, and, while the man lay in bliss on\\n', 'the floor, possessed himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive\\n', 'information, forwarded by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate,\\n', 'made a careful duplicate of the matter, and brought the result to Torpenhow,\\n', 'who said that all was fair in love or war correspondence, and built an\\n', \"excellent descriptive article from his rival's riotous waste of words.

It\\'s by Michael Angelo; all beginners copy it.\\n', 'That scrub\\'s alive with enemy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The camel-corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them, and a\\n', 'hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind\\n', 'of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it. As swiftly as a reach of\\n', 'still water is crisped by the wind, the rock-strewn ridges and scrub-topped\\n', 'hills were troubled and alive with armed men.\\n', '\\n', 'Mercifully, it occurred to these to stand far off for a time, to shout and\\n', 'gesticulate joyously. One man even delivered himself of a long story. The\\n', 'camel-corps did not fire. They were only too glad of a little breathing-space,\\n', 'until some sort of square could be formed. The men on the sand-bank ran to\\n', 'their side; and the whale-boats, as they toiled up within shouting distance,\\n', 'were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all save the sick and a few\\n', 'men to guard them. The Arab orator ceased his outcries, and his friends howled.\\n', '\\n', '\"They look like the Mahdi\\'s men,\" said Torpenhow, elbowing himself into the\\n', 'crush of the square; \"but what thousands of \\'em there are! The tribes hereabout\\n', 'aren\\'t  against us, I know.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then the Mahdi\\'s taken another town,\" said Dick, \"and set all these yelping\\n', 'devils free to show us up.

Hurry up, you men!\"\\n', '\\n', 'There was no need of any order. The men flung themselves panting against the\\n', 'sides of the square, for they had good reason to know that whoso was left\\n', 'outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely\\n', 'unpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound camel-guns posted at one\\n', 'corner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right\\n', 'to get possession of a knoll of rising ground. All had fought in this manner\\n', 'many times before, and there was no novelty in the entertainment; always the\\n', 'same hot and stifling formation, the smell of dust and leather, the same\\n', 'boltlike rush of the enemy, the same pressure on the weakest side, the few\\n', 'minutes of hand-to-hand scuffle, and then the silence of the desert, broken\\n', 'only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse.\\n', 'They had become careless. The camel-guns spoke at intervals, and the square\\n', 'slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels. Then came the attack of\\n', 'three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for\\n', 'troops in close order to attack against breech-loading fire.\\n', '\\n', 'A few dropping shots heralded their approach, and a few horsemen led, but the\\n', 'bulk of the force was naked humanity, mad with rage, and armed with the spear\\n', 'and the sword. The instinct of the desert, where there is always much war, told\\n', 'them that the right flank of the square was the weakest, for they swung clear\\n', 'of the front. The camel-guns shelled them as they passed and opened for an\\n', 'instant lanes through their midst, most like those quick-closing vistas in a\\n', 'Kentish hop-garden seen when the train races by at full speed; and the infantry\\n', 'fire, held till the opportune moment, dropped them in close-packing hundreds.\\n', 'No civilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they\\n', 'came, the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels,\\n', 'the wounded cursing and staggering forward, till they fell--a torrent black as\\n', 'the sliding water above a mill-dam--full on the right flank of the square.\\n', '\\n', 'Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead went\\n', 'out in rolling smoke, and the little stones on the heated ground and the\\n', 'tinder-dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest, for men\\n', 'measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things, counting\\n', 'mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch. There was\\n', 'no semblance of any concerted fighting. For aught the men knew, the enemy might\\n', 'be attempting all four sides of the square at once. Their business was to\\n', 'destroy what lay in front of them, to bayonet in the back those who passed over\\n', 'them, and, dying, to drag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head\\n', 'by some avenging gun-butt.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew unendurable.\\n', 'It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was repulsed, so the\\n', 'three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of the square. There was\\n', 'a rush from without, the short hough-hough of the stabbing spears, and a man on\\n', 'a horse, followed by thirty or forty others, dashed through, yelling and\\n', 'hacking. The right flank of the square sucked in after them, and the other\\n', 'sides sent help. The wounded, who knew that they had but a few hours more to\\n', \"live, caught at the enemy's feet and brought them down, or, staggering into a\\n\", 'discarded rifle, fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the\\n', 'square.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet, that\\n', 'he had fired his revolver into a black, foam-flecked face which forthwith\\n', 'ceased to bear any resemblance to a face, and that Torpenhow had gone down\\n', 'under an Arab whom he had tried to \"collar low,\" and was turning over and over\\n', \"with his captive, feeling for the man's eyes. The doctor jabbed at a venture\\n\", \"with a bayonet, and a helmetless soldier fired over Dick's shoulder: the flying\\n\", 'grains of powder stung his cheek. It was to Torpenhow that Dick turned by\\n', 'instinct. The representative of the Central Southern Syndicate had shaken\\n', 'himself clear of his enemy, and rose, wiping his thumb on his trousers. The\\n', 'Arab, both hands to his forehead, screamed aloud, then snatched up his spear\\n', \"and rushed at Torpenhow, who was panting under shelter of Dick's revolver. Dick\\n\", 'fired twice, and the man dropped limply. His upturned face lacked one eye. The\\n', 'musketry-fire redoubled, but cheers mingled with it. The rush had failed and\\n', 'the enemy were flying. If the heart of the square were shambles, the ground\\n', \"beyond was a butcher's shop. Dick thrust his way forward between the maddened\\n\", 'men. The remnant of the enemy were retiring, as the few--the very few--English\\n', 'cavalry rode down the laggards.\\n', '\\n', 'Beyond the lines of the dead, a broad blood-stained Arab spear cast aside in\\n', 'the retreat lay across a stump of scrub, and beyond this again the illimitable\\n', 'dark levels of the desert. The sun caught the steel and turned it into a red\\n', 'disc. Some one behind him was saying, \"Ah, get away, you brute!\" Dick raised\\n', 'his revolver and pointed towards the desert. His eye was held by the red splash\\n', 'in the distance, and the clamour about him seemed to die down to a very far-\\n', 'away whisper, like the whisper of a level sea. There was the revolver and the\\n', 'red light. . . . and the voice of some one scaring something away, exactly as\\n', 'had fallen somewhere before,--a darkness that stung. He fired at random, and\\n', 'the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered, \"Spoilt my aim. There\\n', 'aren\\'t  any more cartridges. We shall have to run home.\" He put his hand to his\\n', 'head and brought it away covered with blood.\\n', '\\n', '\"Old man, you\\'re cut rather badly,\" said Torpenhow. \"I owe you something for\\n', 'this business. Thanks. Stand up! I say, you can\\'t  be ill here.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Throughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats, a black\\n', 'figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and shouted that Khartoum\\n', 'the accursed one was dead,--was dead,--was dead,--that two steamers were rock-\\n', 'staked on the Nile outside the city, and that of all their crews there remained\\n', 'not one; and Khartoum was dead,--was dead,--was dead! But Torpenhow took no\\n', 'heed. He was watching Dick, who called aloud to the restless Nile for Maisie,--\\n', 'and again Maisie! \"Behold a phenomenon,\" said Torpenhow, rearranging the\\n', 'blanket. \"Here is a man, presumably human, who mentions the name of one woman\\n', \"only.

Dick heaved the letter into the Nile at Cairo,\\n', 'cashed the draft in the same town, and bade a warm farewell to Torpenhow at the\\n', 'station.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am going to lie up for a while and rest,\" said Torpenhow. \"I don\\'t  know\\n', 'where I shall live in London, but if God brings us to meet, we shall meet.\\n', 'Are you staying here on the off-chance of another row?

And through the heart of that sand-\\n', 'bordered hell, where the mirage flickers day long above the Bitter Lake, move,\\n', 'if you will only wait, most of the men and women you have known in this life.\\n', 'Dick established himself in quarters more riotous than respectable. He spent\\n', 'his evenings on the quay, and boarded many ships, and saw very many friends,--\\n', 'gracious Englishwomen with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of\\n', \"Shepherd's Hotel, hurrying war correspondents, skippers of the contract troop-\\n\", 'ships employed in the campaign, army officers by the score, and others of less\\n', 'reputable trades.\\n', '\\n', 'He had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies, and the\\n', 'advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong excitement, at\\n', 'the gaming-tables, saloons, dancing-hells, and elsewhere. For recreation there\\n', 'was the straight vista of the Canal, the blazing sands, the procession of\\n', 'shipping, and the white hospitals where the English soldiers lay. He strove to\\n', 'set down in black and white and colour all that Providence sent him, and when\\n', 'that supply was ended sought about for fresh material. It was a fascinating\\n', 'employment, but it ran away with his money, and he had drawn in advance the\\n', 'hundred and twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly. \"Now I shall have to\\n', 'work and starve!\" thought he, and was addressing himself to this new fate when\\n', 'a mysterious telegram arrived from Torpenhow in England, which said, \"Come\\n', 'back, quick; you have caught on. Come.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A large smile overspread his face. \"So soon! that\\'s a good hearing,\" said he to\\n', 'himself. \"There will be an orgy tonight. I\\'ll stand or fall by my luck. Faith,\\n', 'it\\'s time it came!\" He deposited half of his funds in the hands of his well-\\n', 'known friends Monsieur and Madame Binat, and ordered himself a Zanzibar dance\\n', 'of the finest. Monsieur Binat was shaking with drink, but Madame smiles\\n', 'sympathetically--\"Monsieur needs a chair, of course, and of course Monsieur\\n', 'will sketch; Monsieur amuses himself strangely.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Binat raised a blue-white face from a cot in the inner room. \"I understand,\" he\\n', 'quavered. \"We all know Monsieur. Monsieur is an artist, as I have been.\" Dick\\n', 'nodded. \"In the end,\" said Binat, with gravity, \"Monsieur will descend alive\\n', 'into hell, as I have descended.\" And he laughed.\\n', '\\n', '\"You must come to the dance, too,\" said Dick; \"I shall want you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"For my face? I knew it would be so. For my face? My God! and for my\\n', 'degradation so tremendous! I will not. Take him away. He is a devil. Or at\\n', 'least do thou, Celeste, demand of him more.\" The excellent Binat began to kick\\n', 'and scream.\\n', '\\n', '\"All things are for sale in Port Said,\" said Madame. \"If my husband comes it\\n', 'will be so much more. Eh, \"how you call \\'alf a sovereign.\"\\n', '\\n', ' The money was paid, and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard\\n', \"at the back of Madame Binat's house. The lady herself, in faded mauve silk\\n\", 'always about to slide from her yellow shoulders, played the piano, and to the\\n', 'tin-pot music of a Western waltz the naked Zanzibari girls danced furiously by\\n', 'the light of kerosene lamps. Binat sat upon a chair and stared with eyes that\\n', 'saw nothing, till the whirl of the dance and the clang of the rattling piano\\n', 'stole into the drink that took the place of blood in his veins, and his face\\n', 'glistened. Dick took him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the\\n', 'light. Madame Binat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth. Dick\\n', 'leaned against the wall and sketched for an hour, till the kerosene lamps began\\n', 'to smell, and the girls threw themselves panting on the hard-beaten ground.\\n', 'Then he shut his book with a snap and moved away, Binat plucking feebly at his\\n', 'elbow. \"Show me,\" he whimpered. \"I too was once an artist, even I!\" Dick showed\\n', 'him the rough sketch. \"Am I that?\" he screamed. \"Will you take that away with\\n', 'you and show all the world that it is I,--Binat?\" He moaned and wept.\\n', '\\n', '\"Monsieur has paid for all,\" said Madame. \"To the pleasure of seeing Monsieur\\n', 'again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The courtyard gate shut, and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the nearest\\n', 'gambling-hell, where he was well known. \"If the luck holds, it\\'s an omen; if I\\n', 'lose, I must stay here.\" He placed his money picturesquely about the board,\\n', 'hardly daring to look at what he did. The luck held.\\n', '\\n', 'Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds, and he went down to\\n', 'the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed cargo-steamer, who\\n', 'landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket than he cared to think\\n', 'about.\\n', '\\n', 'A thin gray fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for summer\\n', 'was in England.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a cheerful wilderness, and it hasn\\'t  the knack of altering much,\" Dick\\n', 'thought, as he tramped from the Docks westward. \"Now, what must I do?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The packed houses gave no answer. Dick looked down the long lightless streets\\n', 'and at the appalling rush of traffic. \"Oh, you rabbit-hutches!\" said he,\\n', 'addressing a row of highly respectable semi-detached residences. \"Do you know\\n', 'what you\"ve got to do later on? You have to supply me with men-servants and\\n', 'maid-servants,\"--here he smacked his lips,--\"and the peculiar treasure of\\n', \"kings. Meantime I'll clothes and boots, and presently I will return and trample\\n\", 'on you.\" He stepped forward energetically; he saw that one of his shoes was\\n', 'burst at the side. As he stooped to make investigations, a man jostled him into\\n', 'the gutter. \"All right,\" he said. \"That\"s another nick in the score. I\\'ll\\n', 'jostle you later on.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Good clothes and boots are not cheap, and Dick left his last shop with the\\n', 'certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time, but with only fifty\\n', 'shillings in his pocket. He returned to streets by the Docks, and lodged\\n', 'himself in one room, where the sheets on the bed were almost audibly marked in\\n', 'case of theft, and where nobody seemed to go to bed at all. When his clothes\\n', \"arrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate for Torpenhow's address, and\\n\", 'got it, with the intimation that there was still some money waiting for him.\\n', '\\n', '\"How much?\" said Dick, as one who habitually dealt in millions.\\n', '\\n', '\"Between thirty and forty pounds. If it would be any convenience to you, of\\n', 'course we could let you have it at once; but we usually settle accounts\\n', 'monthly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If I show that I want anything now, I\\'m lost,\" he said to himself. \"All I need\\n', 'I\\'ll take later on.\" Then, aloud, \"It\"s hardly worth while; and I\\'m going to\\n', 'the country for a month, too. Wait till I come back, and I\\'ll see about it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But we trust, Mr. Heldar, that you do not intend to sever your connection with\\n', 'us?\"\\n', '\\n', \" Dick's business in life was the study of faces, and he watched the speaker\\n\", 'keenly. \"That man means something,\" he said. \"I\\'ll do no business till I\"ve\\n', 'seen Torpenhow. There\\'s a big deal coming.\" So he departed, making no promises,\\n', 'to his one little room by the Docks. And that day was the seventh of the month,\\n', 'and that month, he reckoned with awful distinctness, had thirty-one days in it!\\n', 'It is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for\\n', 'twenty-four days on fifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment\\n', 'alone in all the loneliness of London. Dick paid seven shillings a week for his\\n', 'lodging, which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink.\\n', 'Naturally, his first purchase was of the materials of his craft; he had been\\n', \"without them too long. Half a day's investigations and comparison brought him\\n\", 'to the conclusion that sausages and mashed potatoes, twopence a plate, were the\\n', 'best food. Now, sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant.\\n', 'As lunch, even, with mashed potatoes, they become monotonous. At dinner they\\n', 'are impertinent. At the end of three days Dick loathed sausages, and, going,\\n', 'forth, pawned his watch to revel on sheep\"s head, which is not as cheap as it\\n', 'looks, owing to the bones and the gravy. Then he returned to sausages and\\n', 'mashed potatoes. Then he confined himself entirely to mashed potatoes for a\\n', 'day, and was unhappy because of pain in his inside. Then he pawned his\\n', 'waistcoat and his tie, and thought regretfully of money thrown away in times\\n', 'past. There are few things more edifying unto Art than the actual belly-pinch\\n', 'of hunger, and Dick in his few walks abroad,--he did not care for exercise; it\\n', 'raised desires that could not be satisfied--found himself dividing mankind into\\n', 'two classes,--those who looked as if they might give him something to eat, and\\n', 'those who looked otherwise. \"I never knew what I had to learn about the human\\n', 'face before,\" he thought; and, as a reward for his humility, Providence caused\\n', 'a cab-driver at a sausage-shop where Dick fed that night to leave half eaten a\\n', 'great chunk of bread. Dick took it,--would have fought all the world for its\\n', 'possession,--and it cheered him.\\n', '\\n', 'The month dragged through at last, and, nearly prancing with impatience, he\\n', 'went to draw his money. Then he hastened to Torpenhow\"s address and smelt the\\n', 'smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers. Torpenhow was\\n', 'on the top floor, and Dick burst into his room, to be received with a hug which\\n', 'nearly cracked his ribs, as Torpenhow dragged him to the light and spoke of\\n', 'twenty different things in the same breath.\\n', '\\n', '\"But you\\'re looking tucked up,\" he concluded.\\n', '\\n', '\"Got anything to eat?\" said Dick, his eye roaming round the room.\\n', '\\n', '\"I shall be having breakfast in a minute. What do you say to sausages?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, anything but sausages! Torp, I\\'ve been starving on that accursed horse-\\n', 'flesh for thirty days and thirty nights.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Now, what lunacy has been your latest?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech. Then he opened his\\n', 'coat; there was no waistcoat below. \"I ran it fine, awfully fine, but I\\'ve just\\n', 'scraped through.\"                  \\n', '\\n', '\"You haven\\'t  much sense, but you\\'ve got a backbone, anyhow. Eat, and talk\\n', 'afterwards.\" Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could gorge no\\n', 'more. Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe, and he smoked as men smoke who for\\n', 'three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco.\\n', '\\n', '\"Ouf!\" said he. \"That\\'s heavenly! Well?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why in the world didn\\'t  you come to me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Couldn\\'t; I owe you too much already, old man. Besides I had a sort of\\n', \"superstition that this temporary starvation--that's what it was, and it hurt--\\n\", \"would bring me luck later. It's over and done with now, and none of the\\n\", \"syndicate know how hard up I was. Fire away. What's the exact state of affairs\\n\", 'as regards myself?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You had my wire? You\\'ve caught on here. People like your work immensely. I\\n', \"don't  know why, but they do. They say you have a fresh touch and a new way of\\n\", \"drawing things. And, because they're chiefly home-bred English, they say you\\n\", \"have insight. You're wanted by half a dozen papers; you're wanted to illustrate\\n\", 'books.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick grunted scornfully.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the dealers.\\n', 'They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment. Good Lord! who\\n', 'can account for the fathomless folly of the public?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'re a remarkably sensible people.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They are subject to fits, if that\\'s what you mean; and you happen to be the\\n', 'object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they call Art.\\n', \"Just now you're a fashion, a phenomenon, or whatever you please. I appeared to\\n\", 'be the only person who knew anything about you here, and I have been showing\\n', 'the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me from time to time. Those\\n', 'coming after your work on the Central Southern Syndicate appear to have done\\n', 'your business. You\\'re in luck.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Huh! call it luck! Do call it luck, when a man has been kicking about the\\n', \"world like a dog, waiting for it to come! I'll luck 'em later on. I want a\\n\", 'place to work first.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Come here,\" said Torpenhow, crossing the landing. \"This place is a big box\\n', \"room really, but it will do for you. There's your skylight, or your north\\n\", 'light, or whatever window you call it, and plenty of room to thrash about in,\\n', 'and a bedroom beyond. What more do you need?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good enough,\" said Dick, looking round the large room that took up a third of\\n', 'a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames. A pale yellow sun\\n', 'shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the place. Three steps\\n', \"led from the door to the landing, and three more to Torpenhow's room. The well\\n\", 'of the staircase disappeared into darkness, pricked by tiny gas-jets, and there\\n', 'were sounds of men talking and doors slamming seven flights below, in the warm\\n', 'gloom.\\n', '\\n', '\"Do they give you a free hand here?\" said Dick, cautiously. He was Ishmael\\n', 'enough to know the value of liberty.\\n', '\\n', '\"Anything you like; latch-keys and license unlimited. We are permanent tenants\\n', \"for the most part here. 'Tisn't  a place I would recommend for a Young Men's\\n\", 'Christian Association, but it will serve. I took these rooms for you when I\\n', 'wired.\"\\n', '\\n', ' \"You\\'re a great deal too kind, old man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You didn\\'t  suppose you were going away from me, did you?\" Torpenhow put his\\n', \"hand on Dick's shoulder, and the two walked up and down the room, henceforward\\n\", 'to be called the studio, in sweet and silent communion. They heard rapping at\\n', 'Torpenhow\\'s door. \"That\\'s some ruffian come up for a drink,\" said Torpenhow;\\n', 'and he raised his voice cheerily. There entered no one more ruffianly than a\\n', 'portly middle-aged gentleman in a satin-faced frockcoat. His lips were parted\\n', 'and pale, and there were deep pouches under the eyes.\\n', '\\n', '\"Weak heart,\" said Dick to himself, and, as he shook hands, \"very weak heart.\\n', 'His pulse is shaking his fingers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate and\\n', '\"one of the most ardent admirers of your work, Mr. Heldar. I assure you, in the\\n', 'name of the syndicate, that we are immensely indebted to you; and I trust, Mr.\\n', \"Heldar, you won't  forget that we were largely instrumental in bringing you\\n\", 'before the public.\" He panted because of the seven flights of stairs.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick glanced at Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his\\n', 'cheek.\\n', '\\n', '\"I shan\\'t  forget,\" said Dick, every instinct of defence roused in him.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'ve paid me so well that I couldn\\'t, you know. By the way, when I am\\n', 'settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches. There must be\\n', 'nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is er--is what I came to speak about. I fear we can\\'t  allow it exactly,\\n', 'Mr. Heldar. In the absence of any specified agreement, the sketches are our\\n', 'property, of course.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you mean to say that you are going to keep them?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; and we hope to have your help, on your own terms, Mr. Heldar, to assist\\n', 'us in arranging a little exhibition, which, backed by our name and the\\n', 'influence we naturally command among the press, should be of material service\\n', 'to you. Sketches such as yours----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Belong to me. You engaged me by wire, you paid me the lowest rates you dared.\\n', \"You can't  mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they're all I've got in the\\n\", 'world!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow watched Dick\"s face and whistled.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick walked up and down, thinking. He saw the whole of his little stock in\\n', 'trade, the first weapon of his equipment, annexed at the outset of his campaign\\n', 'by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught aright, who said that he\\n', 'represented a syndicate, which was a thing for which Dick had not the least\\n', 'reverence. The injustice of the proceedings did not much move him; he had seen\\n', 'the strong hand prevail too often in other places to be squeamish over the\\n', 'moral aspects of right and wrong.\\n', '\\n', 'But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat, and when\\n', 'he spoke again, it was with a strained sweetness that Torpenhow knew well for\\n', 'the beginning of strife.\\n', '\\n', '\"Forgive me, sir, but you have no--no younger man who can arrange this business\\n', 'with me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I speak for the syndicate. I see no reason for a third party to----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You will in a minute. Be good enough to give back my sketches.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man stared blankly at Dick, and then at Torpenhow, who was leaning against\\n', 'the wall. He was not used to ex-employees who ordered him to be good enough to\\n', 'do things.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, it is rather a cold-blooded steal,\" said Torpenhow, critically; \"but I\\'m\\n', \"afraid, I am very much afraid, you've struck the wrong man. Be careful, Dick;\\n\", 'remember, this isn\\'t  the Soudan.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your name\\n', 'before the world----\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was not a fortunate remark; it reminded Dick of certain vagrant years\\n', 'lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires. The memory did not\\n', 'contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the fruit of\\n', 'those years.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t  know quite what to do with you,\" began Dick, meditatively. \"Of course\\n', \"you're a thief, and you ought to be half killed, but in your case you'd\\n\", \"probably die. I don't  want you dead on this floor, and, besides, it's unlucky\\n\", 'just as one\"s moving in. Don\\'t  hit, sir; you\\'ll only excite yourself.\"\\n', '\\n', \"He put one hand on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump body\\n\", 'beneath the coat. \"My goodness!\" said he to Torpenhow, \"and this gray oaf dares\\n', 'to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh camel-driver have the black hide taken off\\n', 'his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates, and he was as tough\\n', 'as whipcord. This thing\\'s soft all over--like a woman.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a man\\n', 'who does not intend to strike. The head of the syndicate began to breathe\\n', 'heavily. Dick walked round him, pawing him, as a cat paws a soft hearth-rug.\\n', 'Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches underneath the eyes, and\\n', 'shook his head. \"You were going to steal my things,--mine, mine, mine!--you,\\n', \"who don't  know when you may die. Write a note to your office,--you say you're\\n\", 'the head of it,--and order them to give Torpenhow my sketches,--every one of\\n', 'them. Wait a minute: your hand\\'s shaking. Now!\" He thrust a pocket-book before\\n', 'him. The note was written. Torpenhow took it and departed without a word, while\\n', 'Dick walked round and round the spellbound captive, giving him such advice as\\n', 'he conceived best for the welfare of his soul. When Torpenhow returned with a\\n', 'gigantic portfolio, he heard Dick say, almost soothingly, \"Now, I hope this\\n', 'will be a lesson to you; and if you worry me when I have settled down to work\\n', \"with any nonsense about actions for assault, believe me, I'll catch you and\\n\", \"manhandle you, and you'll die. You haven't  very long to live, anyhow. Go!\\n\", 'Imshi, Vootsak,--get out!\" The man departed, staggering and dazed. Dick drew a\\n', 'long breath: \"Phew! what a lawless lot these people are! The first thing a poor\\n', 'orphan meets is gang robbery, organised burglary! Think of the hideous\\n', 'blackness of that man\\'s mind! Are my sketches all right, Torp?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; one hundred and forty-seven of them. Well, I must say, Dick, you\\'ve begun\\n', 'well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He was interfering with me.

Bring your things up from whatever place\\n', 'you\\'re staying in, and we\"ll try to make this barn a little more shipshape.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And then--oh, then,\" said Dick, still capering, \"we will spoil the Egyptians!\"\\n', '\\n', ' CHAPTER IV\\n', '                                        \\n', ' The wolf-cub at even lay hid in the corn,\\n', ' When the smoke of the cooking hung gray:\\n', ' He knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn,\\n', ' And he looked to his strength for his prey.\\n', '\\n', ' But the moon swept the smoke-wreaths away.\\n', '\\n', ' And he turned from his meal in the villager\"s close,\\n', ' And he bayed to the moon as she rose.\\n', '           --In Seonee.\\n', '\\n', '\"WELL, and how does success taste?\" said Torpenhow, some three months later.

Others, clumsy and coarse-built for the most part, were alight\\n', 'with love; others were merely drawn and lined with work; but there was\\n', 'something, Dick knew, to be made out of them all. The poor at least should\\n', 'suffer that he might learn, and the rich should pay for the output of his\\n', 'learning.

A girl hard pressed by\\n', 'her lover shouted shamelessly, \"Ah, get away, you beast!\" and a shift of the\\n', 'same wind that had opened the fog drove across Dick\"s face the black smoke of a\\n', 'river-steamer at her berth below the wall. He was blinded for the moment, then\\n', 'spun round and found himself face to face with--Maisie.\\n', '\\n', 'There was no mistaking. The years had turned the child to a woman, but they had\\n', 'not altered the dark-gray eyes, the thin scarlet lips, or the firmly modelled\\n', 'mouth and chin; and, that all should be as it was of old, she wore a closely\\n', 'fitting gray dress.\\n', '\\n', 'Since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own command,\\n', 'Dick, advancing, said \"Halloo!\" after the manner of schoolboys, and Maisie\\n', 'answered, \"Oh, Dick, is that you?\" Then, against his will, and before the brain\\n', 'newly released from considerations of the cash balance had time to dictate to\\n', \"the nerves, every pulse of Dick's body throbbed furiously and his palate dried\\n\", \"in his mouth. The fog shut down again, and Maisie's face was pearl-white\\n\", 'through it. No word was spoken, but Dick fell into step at her side, and the\\n', 'two paced the Embankment together, keeping the step as perfectly as in their\\n', 'afternoon excursions to the mud-flats. Then Dick, a little hoarsely--\"What has\\n', 'happened to Amomma?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He died, Dick. Not cartridges; over-eating. He was always greedy. Isn\\'t  it\\n', 'funny?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes.

They're contrary brutes,\\n\", 'and they do things without any reason.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick had turned northward across the Park, but he was walking in the spirit on\\n', 'the mud-flats with Maisie. He laughed aloud as he remembered the day when he\\n', \"had decked Amomma's horns with the ham-frills, and Maisie, white with rage, had\\n\", 'cuffed him. How long those four years seemed in review, and how closely Maisie\\n', 'was connected with every hour of them! Storm across the sea, and Maisie in a\\n', 'gray dress on the beach, sweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and\\n', 'laughing at the homeward race of the fishing-smacks; hot sunshine on the mud-\\n', 'flats, and Maisie sniffing scornfully, with her chin in the air; Maisie flying\\n', 'before the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot\\n', 'about her ears; Maisie, very composed and independent, telling lies to Mrs.\\n', 'Jennett while Dick supported her with coarser perjuries; Maisie picking her way\\n', 'delicately from stone to stone, a pistol in her hand and her teeth firm-set;\\n', 'and Maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass between the mouth of a cannon\\n', 'and a nodding yellow sea-poppy. The pictures passed before him one by one, and\\n', 'the last stayed the longest.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind as it\\n', 'was foreign to his experiences. It never occurred to him that there might be\\n', 'other calls upon his time than loafing across the Park in the forenoon.\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s a good working light now,\" he said, watching his shadow placidly.\\n', '\"Some poor devil ought to be grateful for this. And there\\'s Maisie.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was walking towards him from the Marble Arch, and he saw that no mannerism\\n', 'of her gait had been changed. It was good to find her still Maisie, and, so to\\n', 'speak, his next-door neighbour. No greeting passed between them, because there\\n', 'had been none in the old days.\\n', '\\n', '\"What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?\" said Dick, as one who was\\n', 'entitled to ask.\\n', '\\n', '\"Idling. Just idling. I got angry with a chin and scraped it out. Then I left\\n', 'it in a little heap of paint-chips and came away.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know what palette-knifing means. What was the piccy?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A fancy head that wouldn\\'t come right,--horrid thing!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t like working over scraped paint when I\\'m doing flesh. The grain comes\\n', 'up woolly as the paint dries.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not if you scrape properly.\" Maisie waved her hand to illustrate her methods.\\n', 'There was a dab of paint on the white cuff. Dick laughed.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re as untidy as ever.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That comes well from you. Look at your own cuff.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"By Jove, yes! It\\'s worse than yours. I don\\'t think we\\'ve much altered in\\n', 'anything. Let\\'s see, though.\" He looked at Maisie critically. The pale blue\\n', 'haze of an autumn day crept between the tree-trunks of the Park and made a\\n', 'background for the gray dress, the black velvet toque above the black hair, and\\n', 'the resolute profile.\\n', '\\n', '\"No, there\\'s nothing changed. How good it is! D\\'you remember when I fastened\\n', 'your hair into the snap of a hand-bag?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie nodded, with a twinkle in her eyes, and turned her full face to Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"Wait a minute,\" said he. \"That mouth is down at the corners a little. Who\\'s\\n', 'been worrying you, Maisie?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No one but myself. I never seem to get on with my work, and yet I try hard\\n', 'enough, and Kami says----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Continuez, mesdemoiselles. Continuez toujours, mes enfants.\\' Kami is\\n', 'depressing. I beg your pardon.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, that\\'s what he says.

The Salon.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You fly high.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve been beating my wings long enough. Where do you exhibit, Dick?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t exhibit.

He cast about\\n', 'for some means of conviction. They were not far from the Marble Arch. \"Come up\\n', 'Oxford Street a little and I\\'ll show you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A small knot of people stood round a print-shop that Dick knew well.\\n', '\\n', '\"Some reproduction of my work inside,\" he said, with suppressed triumph. Never\\n', 'before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue. \"You see the sort of things\\n', 'I paint. D\\'you like it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a field-battery going into action\\n', 'under fire. Two artillery-men stood behind her in the crowd.\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ve chucked the off lead-\\'orse\" said one to the other. \"\\'E\\'s tore up\\n', \"awful, but they're makin' good time with the others.

Oh, I did want it so!\" she said at last, under her breath.\\n', '\\n', '\"Me,--all me!\" said Dick, placidly. \"Look at their faces. It hits \\'em.

Oh, what a thing to have come to one!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Come to one, indeed! I had to go out and look for it. What do you think?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I call it success. Tell me how you got it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They returned to the Park, and Dick delivered himself of the saga of his own\\n', 'doings, with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman.\\n', '\\n', \"From the beginning he told the tale, the I--I--I's flashing through the records\\n\", 'as telegraph-poles fly past the traveller. Maisie listened and nodded her head.\\n', \"The histories of strife and privation did not move her a hair's-breadth. At the\\n\", 'end of each canto he would conclude, \"And that gave me some notion of handling\\n', 'colour,\" or light, or whatever it might be that he had set out to pursue and\\n', 'understand. He led her breathless across half the world, speaking as he had\\n', 'never spoken in his life before.\\n', '\\n', 'And in the flood-tide of his exaltation there came upon him a great desire to\\n', 'pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said, \"I understand. Go on,\"--to\\n', 'pick her up and carry her away with him, because she was Maisie, and because\\n', 'she understood, and because she was his right, and a woman to be desired above\\n', 'all women.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he checked himself abruptly. \"And so I took all I wanted,\" he said, \"and I\\n', 'had to fight for it. Now you tell.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Maisie's tale was almost as gray as her dress. It covered years of patient toil\\n\", 'backed by savage pride that would not be broken though dealers laughed, and\\n', 'fogs delayed work, and Kami was unkind and even sarcastic, and girls in other\\n', 'studios were painfully polite. It had a few bright spots, in pictures accepted\\n', 'at provincial exhibitions, but it wound up with the oft repeated wail, \"And so\\n', 'you see, Dick, I had no success, though I worked so hard.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then pity filled Dick. Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not hit the\\n', 'breakwater, half an hour before she had kissed him. And that had happened\\n', 'yesterday.\\n', '\\n', '\"Never mind,\" he said. \"I\\'ll tell you something, if you\\'ll believe it.\" The\\n', 'words were shaping themselves of their own accord. \"The whole thing, lock,\\n', 'stock, and barrel, isn\\'t worth one big yellow sea-poppy below Fort Keeling.\"\\n', '                    \\n', 'Maisie flushed a little. \"It\\'s all very well for you to talk, but you\\'ve had\\n', 'the success and I haven\\'t.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me talk, then.

There was triumph in them, because he could not conceive that Maisie\\n', 'should refuse sooner or later to love him, since he loved her.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s wrong of me,\" said Maisie, more slowly than before; \"it\\'s wrong and\\n', \"selfish; but, oh, I've been so lonely!

We belong.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We don\\'t; but you always understood me, and there is so much in my work that\\n', 'you could help me in. You know things and the ways of doing things.

Isn\\'t that it, Maisie?\"\\n', '\\n', \"Again there was triumph in Dick's eye.\\n\", '\\n', '\"It\\'s too good of you,--much too good.

But, Maisie, you believe, don\\'t you, that I love\\n', 'you? I don\\'t want you to have any false notions about brothers and sisters.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s absurd, but--I believe. I wish I could send you away before you get angry\\n', 'with me. But--but the girl that lives with me is red-haired, and an\\n', 'impressionist, and all our notions clash.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"So do ours, I think. Never mind. Three months from today we shall be laughing\\n', 'at this together.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie shook her head mournfully. \"I knew you wouldn\\'t understand, and it will\\n', 'only hurt you more when you find out. Look at my face, Dick, and tell me what\\n', 'you see.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They stood up and faced each other for a moment. The fog was gathering, and it\\n', 'stifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings. Dick brought all\\n', 'his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes, mouth, and chin\\n', 'underneath the black velvet toque.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s the same Maisie, and it\\'s the same me,\" he said. \"We\\'ve both nice little\\n', 'wills of our own, and one or other of us has to be broken. Now about the\\n', 'future. I must come and see your pictures some day,--I suppose when the red-\\n', 'haired girl is on the premises.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sundays are my best times. You must come on Sundays. There are such heaps of\\n', 'things I want to talk about and ask your advice about. Now I must get back to\\n', 'work.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Try to find out before next Sunday what I am,\" said Dick. \"Don\\'t take my word\\n', 'for anything I\\'ve told you. Good-bye, darling, and bless you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie stole away like a little gray mouse. Dick watched her till she was out\\n', 'of sight, but he did not hear her say to herself, very soberly, \"I\\'m a wretch,-\\n', '-a horrid, selfish wretch. But it\\'s Dick, and Dick will understand.\"\\n', '\\n', 'No one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force meets\\n', 'the immovable post, though many have thought deeply, even as Dick thought. He\\n', 'tried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in a few weeks by his mere\\n', 'presence and discourse to a better way of thinking. Then he remembered much too\\n', 'distinctly her face and all that was written on it.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I know anything of heads,\" he said, \"there\\'s everything in that face but\\n', \"love. I shall have to put that in myself; and that chin and mouth won't be won\\n\", \"for nothing. But she's right. She knows what she wants, and she's going to get\\n\", 'it. What insolence! Me! Of all the people in the wide world, to use me! But\\n', \"then she's Maisie. There's no getting over that fact; and it's good to see her\\n\", 'again. This business must have been simmering at the back of my head for years.\\n', \". . . She'll use me as I used Binat at Port Said. She's quite right. It will\\n\", 'hurt a little. I shall have to see her every Sunday,--like a young man courting\\n', \"a housemaid. She's sure to come around; and yet--that mouth isn't a yielding\\n\", 'mouth. I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time, and I shall have to look at\\n', \"her pictures,--I don't even know what sort of work she does yet,--and I shall\\n\", \"have to talk about Art,--Woman's Art! Therefore, particularly and perpetually,\\n\", \"damn all varieties of Art. It did me a good turn once, and now it's in my way.\\n\", 'I\\'ll go home and do some Art.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Half-way to the studio, Dick was smitten with a terrible thought. The figure of\\n', 'a solitary woman in the fog suggested it.\\n', '\\n', '\"She\\'s all alone in London, with a red-haired impressionist girl, who probably\\n', \"has the digestion of an ostrich. Most red-haired people have. Maisie's a\\n\", \"bilious little body. They'll eat like lone women,--meals at all hours, and tea\\n\", 'with all meals. I remember how the students in Paris used to pig along. She may\\n', \"fall ill at any minute, and I shan't be able to help. Whew! this is ten times\\n\", 'worse than owning a wife.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk, and looked at Dick with eyes full of the\\n', 'austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same oar\\n', 'together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil. This is a\\n', 'good love, and, since it allows, and even encourages, strife, recrimination,\\n', 'and brutal sincerity, does not die, but grows, and is proof against any absence\\n', 'and evil conduct.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council. He\\n', 'thought of Maisie and her possible needs. It was a new thing to think of\\n', 'anybody but Torpenhow, who could think for himself. Here at last was an outlet\\n', 'for that cash balance. He could adorn Maisie barbarically with jewelry,--a\\n', 'thick gold necklace round that little neck, bracelets upon the rounded arms,\\n', 'and rings of price upon her hands,--the cool, temperate, ringless hands that he\\n', 'had taken between his own. It was an absurd thought, for Maisie would not even\\n', 'allow him to put one ring on one finger, and she would laugh at golden\\n', 'trappings. It would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk, his arm\\n', 'around her neck and her face on his shoulder, as befitted husband and wife.\\n', \"Torpenhow's boots creaked that night, and his strong voice jarred. Dick's brows\\n\", 'contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as\\n', 'a right and part payment for past discomfort, and now he was checked in his\\n', 'stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly care for\\n', 'him.\\n', '\\n', '\"I say, old man,\" said Torpenhow, who had made one or two vain attempts at\\n', 'conversation, \"I haven\\'t put your back up by anything I\\'ve said lately, have\\n', 'I?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You! No. How could you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Liver out of order?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The truly healthy man doesn\\'t know he has a liver. I\\'m only a bit worried\\n', 'about things in general. I suppose it\\'s my soul.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The truly healthy man doesn\\'t know he has a soul. What business have you with\\n', 'luxuries of that kind?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It came of itself. Who\\'s the man that says that we\\'re all islands shouting\\n', 'lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'s right, whoever he is,--except about the misunderstanding. I don\\'t think\\n', 'we could misunderstand each other.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds. Then Torpenhow,\\n', 'insinuatingly--\"Dick, is it a woman?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Be hanged if it\\'s anything remotely resembling a woman; and if you begin to\\n', \"talk like that, I'll hire a red-brick studio with white paint trimmings, and\\n\", 'begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among three-and-sixpenny pot-\\n', \"palms, and I'll mount all my pics in aniline-dye plush plasters, and I'll\\n\", 'invite every woman who maunders over what her guide-books tell her is Art, and\\n', \"you shall receive 'em, Torp,--in a snuff-brown velvet coat with yellow trousers\\n\", 'and an orange tie.

It\\n', 'hurts more than I expected; but the Queen can do no wrong; and she certainly\\n', 'has some notion of drawing.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisie,--always under the green eyes of\\n', 'the red-haired impressionist girl, whom he learned to hate at sight,--and was\\n', 'tingling with a keen sense of shame. Sunday after Sunday, putting on his best\\n', 'clothes, he had walked over to the untidy house north of the Park, first to see\\n', \"Maisie's pictures, and then to criticise and advise upon them as he realised\\n\", 'that they were productions on which advice would not be wasted. Sunday after\\n', 'Sunday, and his love grew with each visit, he had been compelled to cram his\\n', 'heart back from between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie several\\n', 'times and very much indeed. Sunday after Sunday, the head above the heart had\\n', 'warned him that Maisie was not yet attainable, and that it would be better to\\n', 'talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the craft that was all in\\n', 'all to her. Therefore it was his fate to endure weekly torture in the studio\\n', 'built out over the clammy back garden of a frail stuffy little villa where\\n', 'nothing was ever in its right place and nobody every called,--to endure and to\\n', 'watch Maisie moving to and fro with the teacups. He abhorred tea, but, since it\\n', 'gave him a little longer time in her presence, he drank it devoutly, and the\\n', 'red-haired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking. She was\\n', 'always watching him.\\n', '\\n', 'Once, and only once, when she had left the studio, Maisie showed him an album\\n', 'that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers,--the briefest of hurried\\n', 'notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying exhibitions. Dick stooped and\\n', 'kissed the paint-smudged thumb on the open page. \"Oh, my love, my love,\" he\\n', 'muttered, \"do you value these things? Chuck \\'em into the waste-paper basket!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not till I get something better,\" said Maisie, shutting the book.\\n', '\\n', 'Then Dick, moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for the\\n', 'maiden, did deliberately propose, in order to secure more of these coveted\\n', 'cuttings, that he should paint a picture which Maisie should sign.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s childish,\" said Maisie, \"and I didn\\'t think it of you.

It demanded, among other things,\\n', 'an exposition of the faith that was in him.\\n', '\\n', \"Torpenhow's hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with which\\n\", 'Dick preached his own gospel of Art.\\n', '\\n', \"A month before, Dick would have been equally astonished; but it was Maisie's\\n\", 'will and pleasure, and he dragged his words together to make plain to her\\n', 'comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys and wherefores of\\n', 'work. There is not the least difficulty in doing a thing if you only know how\\n', 'to do it; the trouble is to explain your method.\\n', '\\n', '\"I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand,\" said Dick, despairingly,\\n', 'over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would not \"look flesh,\"--it\\n', 'was the same chin that she had scraped out with the palette knife,--\"but I find\\n', \"it almost impossible to teach you.

With line you\\n', 'must go forward or backward, and it will show up all your weaknesses.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But other people----\" began Maisie.\\n', '\\n', '\"You mustn\\'t mind what other people do. If their souls were your soul, it would\\n', \"be different. You stand and fall by your own work, remember, and it's waste of\\n\", 'time to think of any one else in this battle.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick paused, and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came back\\n', 'into his eyes. He looked at Maisie, and the look asked as plainly as words, Was\\n', 'it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and counsel and join\\n', 'hands with Life and Love? Maisie assented to the new programme of schooling so\\n', 'adorably that Dick could hardly restrain himself from picking her up then and\\n', \"there and carrying her off to the nearest registrar's office. It was the\\n\", 'implicit obedience to the spoken word and the blank indifference to the\\n', 'unspoken desire that baffled and buffeted his soul. He held authority in that\\n', 'house,--authority limited, indeed, to one-half of one afternoon in seven, but\\n', 'very real while it lasted. Maisie had learned to appeal to him on many\\n', 'subjects, from the proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky\\n', 'chimney. The red-haired girl never consulted him about anything.\\n', '\\n', 'On the other hand, she accepted his appearances without protest, and watched\\n', 'him always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular\\n', 'and fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles, and biscuit, as he had\\n', 'suspected from the beginning. The girls were supposed to market week and week\\n', 'about, but they lived, with the help of a charwoman, as casually as the young\\n', 'ravens. Maisie spent most of her income on models, and the other girl revelled\\n', 'in apparatus as refined as her work was rough. Armed with knowledge, dear-\\n', 'bought from the Docks, Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation meant\\n', 'the crippling of power to work, which was considerably worse than death.\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie took the warning, and gave more thought to what she ate and drank. When\\n', 'his trouble returned upon him, as it generally did in the long winter\\n', 'twilights, the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and his\\n', 'coercion with a hearth-brush of the smoky drawing-room chimney stung Dick like\\n', 'a whip-lash.\\n', '\\n', 'He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings, till one\\n', \"Sunday, the red-haired girl announced that she would make a study of Dick's\\n\", 'head, and that he would be good enough to sit still, and--quite as an\\n', 'afterthought--look at Maisie. He sat, because he could not well refuse, and for\\n', 'the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people in the past whom he\\n', 'had laid open for the purposes of his own craft. He remembered Binat most\\n', 'distinctly,--that Binat who had once been an artist and talked about\\n', 'degradation.\\n', '\\n', 'It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head, but it presented the dumb\\n', 'waiting, the longing, and, above all, the hopeless enslavement of the man, in a\\n', 'spirit of bitter mockery.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ll buy it,\" said Dick, promptly, \"at your own price.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My price is too high, but I dare say you\\'ll be as grateful if----\" The wet\\n', \"sketch, fluttered from the girl's hand and fell into the ashes of the studio\\n\", 'stove. When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, it\\'s all spoiled!\" said Maisie. \"And I never saw it. Was it like?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Thank you,\" said Dick under his breath to the red-haired girl, and he removed\\n', 'himself swiftly.\\n', '\\n', '\"How that man hates me!\" said the girl. \"And how he loves you, Maisie!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What nonsense? I knew Dick\\'s very fond of me, but he had his work to do, and I\\n', 'have mine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, he is fond of you, and I think he knows there is something in\\n', 'impressionism, after all. Maisie, can\\'t you see?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"See? See what?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing; only, I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that man\\n', \"looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But he hates me. Oh, how he hates\\n\", 'me!\"\\n', '\\n', \"She was not altogether correct. Dick's hatred was tempered with gratitude for a\\n\", 'few moments, and then he forgot the girl entirely. Only the sense of shame\\n', 'remained, and he was nursing it across the Park in the fog. \"There\\'ll be an\\n', 'explosion one of these days,\" he said wrathfully. \"But it isn\\'t Maisie\\'s fault;\\n', \"she's right, quite right, as far as she knows, and I can't blame her. This\\n\", 'business has been going on for three months nearly. Three months!--and it cost\\n', 'me ten years\" knocking about to get at the notion, the merest raw notion, of my\\n', \"work. That's true; but then I didn't have pins, drawing-pins, and palette-\\n\", 'knives, stuck into me every Sunday.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, my little darling, if ever I break you, somebody will have a very bad time\\n', 'of it. No, she won\\'t. I\"d be as big a fool about her as I am now. I\\'ll poison\\n', \"that red-haired girl on my wedding-day,--she's unwholesome,--and now I'll pass\\n\", 'on these present bad times to Torp.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the sin of\\n', 'levity, and Dick and listened and replied not a word. In the weeks between the\\n', 'first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung himself savagely into his\\n', 'work, resolved that Maisie should at least know the full stretch of his powers.\\n', 'Then he had taught Maisie that she must not pay the least attention to any work\\n', 'outside her own, and Maisie had obeyed him all too well. She took his counsels,\\n', 'but was not interested in his pictures.\\n', '\\n', '\"Your things smell of tobacco and blood,\" she said once. \"Can\\'t you do anything\\n', 'except soldiers?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I could do a head of you that would startle you,\" thought Dick,--this was\\n', 'before the red-haired girl had brought him under the guillotine,--but he only\\n', 'said, \"I am very sorry,\" and harrowed Torpenhow\\'s soul that evening with\\n', 'blasphemies against Art. Later, insensibly and to a large extent against his\\n', 'own will, he ceased to interest himself in his own work.\\n', '\\n', \"For Maisie's sake, and to soothe the self-respect that it seemed to him he lost\\n\", 'each Sunday, he would not consciously turn out bad stuff, but, since Maisie did\\n', 'not care even for his best, it were better not to do anything at all save wait\\n', 'and mark time between Sunday and Sunday. Torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks\\n', 'went by fruitless, and then attacked him one Sunday evening when Dick felt\\n', \"utterly exhausted after three hours' biting self-restraint in Maisie's\\n\", 'presence. There was Language, and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai,\\n', 'who had come it to talk continental politics.\\n', '\\n', '\"Bone-idle, is he? Careless, and touched in the temper?\" said the Nilghai. \"It\\n', 'isn\\'t worth worrying over. Dick is probably playing the fool with a woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Isn\\'t that bad enough?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No. She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a while.\\n', 'She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase: one never\\n', 'knows. But until Dick speaks of his own accord you had better not touch him. He\\n', 'is no easy-tempered man to handle.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No; I wish he were. He is such an aggressive, cocksure, you-be-damned fellow.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'ll get that knocked out of him in time. He must learn that he can\\'t storm\\n', 'up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush.\\n', '\\n', 'You\\'re fond of him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'d take any punishment that\\'s in store for him if I could; but the worst of\\n', 'it is, no man can save his brother.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, and the worser of it is, there is no discharge in this war. Dick must\\n', \"learn his lesson like the rest of us. Talking of war, there'll be trouble in\\n\", 'the Balkans in the spring.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That trouble is long coming. I wonder if we could drag Dick out there when it\\n', 'comes off?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick entered the room soon afterwards, and the question was put to him.\\n', '\\n', '\"Not good enough,\" he said shortly. \"I\\'m too comf\\'y where I am.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Surely you aren\\'t taking all the stuff in the papers seriously?\" said the\\n', 'Nilghai. \"Your vogue will be ended in less than six months,--the public will\\n', 'know your touch and go on to something new,--and where will you be then?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Here, in England.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When you might be doing decent work among us out there? Nonsense! I shall go,\\n', 'the Keneu will be there, Torp will be there, Cassavetti will be there, and the\\n', 'whole lot of us will be there, and we shall have as much as ever we can do,\\n', 'with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that would make\\n', 'the reputation of three Verestchagins.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Um!\" said Dick, pulling at his pipe.\\n', '\\n', '\"You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your\\n', \"pictures?

When twenty thousand of him find time to look up between mouthfuls\\n', \"and grunt something about something they aren't the least interested in, the\\n\", 'net result is called fame, reputation, or notoriety, according to the taste and\\n', 'fancy of the speller my lord.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know that as well as you do. Give me credit for a little gumption.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Be hanged if I do!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Be hanged, then; you probably will be,--for a spy, by excited Turks. Heigh-ho!\\n', 'I\\'m weary, dead weary, and virtue has gone out of me.\" Dick dropped into a\\n', 'chair, and was fast asleep in a minute.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s a bad sign,\" said the Nilghai, in an undertone.\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to burn,\\n', 'and put a pillow behind the head. \"We can\\'t help; we can\\'t help,\" he said.\\n', '\"It\\'s a good ugly sort of old cocoanut, and I\\'m fond of it. There\\'s the scar of\\n', 'the wipe he got when he was cut over in the square.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Shouldn\\'t wonder if that has made him a trifle mad.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should. He\\'s a most businesslike madman.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then Dick began to snore furiously.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, here, no affection can stand this sort of thing. Wake up, Dick, and go and\\n', 'sleep somewhere else, if you intend to make a noise about it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When a cat has been out on the tiles all night,\" said the Nilghai, in his\\n', 'beard, \"I notice that she usually sleeps all day.

In the night-watches he was\\n', 'overtaken with an idea, so simple and so luminous that he wondered he had never\\n', 'conceived it before. It was full of craft. He would seek Maisie on a week-day,-\\n', '-would suggest an excursion, and would take her by train to Fort Keeling, over\\n', 'the very ground that they two had trodden together ten years ago.\\n', '\\n', '\"As a general rule,\" he explained to his chin-lathered reflection in the\\n', 'morning, \"it isn\\'t safe to cross an old trail twice. Things remind one of\\n', 'things, and a cold wind gets up, and you feel sad; but this is an exception to\\n', 'every rule that ever was.

She was not pleased to\\n', 'see him; for week-day visits were a stretch of the bond; and it needed all his\\n', 'courage to explain his errand.\\n', '\\n', '\"I know you\\'ve been working too hard,\" he concluded, with an air of authority.\\n', '\"If you do that, you\\'ll break down. You had much better come.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Where?\" said Maisie, wearily. She had been standing before her easel too long,\\n', 'and was very tired.\\n', '\\n', '\"Anywhere you please. We\\'ll take a train tomorrow and see where it stops.

Palaces\\n', 'of marble, and not sordid imitation of grained wood, were surely the fittest\\n', 'background for such a divinity. The red-haired girl drew her into the studio\\n', 'for a moment and kissed her hurriedly.\\n', '\\n', \"Maisie's eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead; she was altogether unused\\n\", 'to these demonstrations. \"Mind my hat,\" she said, hurrying away, and ran down\\n', 'the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom.\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you quite warm enough!

For less than half the\\n', 'fraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie, comfortably settled by the\\n', 'waiting-room fire, that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the booking-\\n', \"office than to elbow one's own way through the crowd.  Dick put her into a\\n\", 'Pullman,--solely on account of the warmth there; and she regarded the\\n', 'extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved out into the\\n', 'country.\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish I knew where we are going,\" she repeated for the twentieth time.\\n', '\\n', 'The name of a well-remembered station flashed by, towards the end of the run,\\n', 'and Maisie was delighted.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, Dick, you villain!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, I thought you might like to see the place again. You haven\\'t been here\\n', 'since the old times, have you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No. I never cared to see Mrs. Jennett again; and she was all that was ever\\n', 'there.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not quite.

How she beat you for it! I never told it was you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She guessed. I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was burying\\n', 'Amomma alive in the potatoes, and you believed me. You had a trusting nature in\\n', 'those days.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They laughed and leaned to look out, identifying ancient landmarks with many\\n', \"reminiscences. Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie's cheek, very\\n\", 'near his own, and watched the blood rise under the clear skin. He congratulated\\n', 'himself upon his cunning, and looked that the evening would bring him a great\\n', 'reward.\\n', '\\n', 'When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes.\\n', 'First, but from a distance, they regarded the house of Mrs. Jennett.\\n', '\\n', '\"Suppose she should come out now, what would you do?\" said Dick, with mock\\n', 'terror.\\n', '\\n', '\"I should make a face.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Show, then,\" said Dick, dropping into the speech of childhood.\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa, and Dick\\n', 'laughed.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'This is disgraceful,\\'\" said Maisie, mimicking Mrs. Jennett\\'s tone. \"\\'Maisie,\\n', 'you run in at once, and learn the collect, gospel, and epistle for the next\\n', \"three Sundays.

Do I--does this worrying bore you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No. It does not.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\"d tell me if it did?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should let you know, I think.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Thank you. The other thing is fatal. But you must learn to forgive a man when\\n', 'he\\'s in love. He\\'s always a nuisance. You must have known that?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie did not consider the last question worth answering, and Dick was forced\\n', 'to repeat it.\\n', '\\n', '\"There were other men, of course. They always worried just when I was in the\\n', 'middle of my work, and wanted me to listen to them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did you listen?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"At first; and they couldn\\'t understand why I didn\\'t care. And they used to\\n', 'praise my pictures; and I thought they meant it. I used to be proud of the\\n', 'praise, and tell Kami, and--I shall never forget--once Kami laughed at me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You don\\'t like being laughed at, Maisie, do you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I hate it. I never laugh at other people unless--unless they do bad work.\\n', 'Dick, tell me honestly what you think of my pictures generally,--of everything\\n', 'of mine that you\\'ve seen.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Honest, honest, and honest over!\\'\" quoted Dick from a catchword of long ago.\\n', '\"Tell me what Kami always says.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie hesitated. \"He--he says that there is feeling in them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How dare you tell me a fib like that? Remember, I was under Kami for two\\n', 'years. I know exactly what he says.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It isn\\'t a fib.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s worse; it\\'s a half-truth. Kami says, when he puts his head on one side,--\\n', 'so, \\'Il y a du sentiment, mais il n\\'y a pas de parti pris.\\'\" He rolled\\n', 'the r threateningly, as Kami used to do.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, that is what he says; and I\\'m beginning to think that he is right.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly he is.\" Dick admitted that two people in the world could do and say\\n', 'no wrong. Kami was the man.\\n', '\\n', '\"And now you say the same thing. It\\'s so disheartening.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m sorry, but you asked me to speak the truth. Besides, I love you too much\\n', \"to pretend about your work. It's strong, it's patient sometimes,--not always,--\\n\", \"and sometimes there's power in it, but there's no special reason why it should\\n\", 'be done at all. At least, that\\'s how it strikes me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s no special reason why anything in the world should ever be done. You\\n', 'know that as well as I do. I only want success.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re going the wrong way to get it, then. Hasn\\'t Kami ever told you so?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t quote Kami to me. I want to know what you think. My work\\'s bad, to begin\\n', 'with.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I didn\\'t say that, and I don\\'t think it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s amateurish, then.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That it most certainly is not. You\\'re a work-woman, darling, to your boot-\\n', 'heels, and I respect you for that.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You don\\'t laugh at me behind my back?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, dear. You see, you are more to me than any one else. Put this cloak thing\\n', 'round you, or you\\'ll get chilled.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins, turning the gray kangaroo fur\\n', 'to the outside. \"This is delicious,\" she said, rubbing her chin thoughtfully\\n', 'along the fur.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well? Why am I wrong in trying to get a little success?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Just because you try. Don\\'t you understand, darling? Good work has nothing to\\n', \"do with--doesn't belong to--the person who does it. It's put into him or her\\n\", 'from outside.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But how does that affect----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Wait a minute. All we can do is to learn how to do our work, to be masters of\\n', 'our materials instead of servants, and never to be afraid of anything.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I understand that.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Everything else comes from outside ourselves. Very good. If we sit down\\n', 'quietly to work out notions that are sent to us, we may or we may not do\\n', \"something that isn't bad. A great deal depends on being master of the bricks\\n\", 'and mortar of the trade. But the instant we begin to think about success and\\n', 'the effect of our work--to play with one eye on the gallery--we lose power and\\n', \"touch and everything else. At least that's how I have found it. Instead of\\n\", \"being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work, you're fretting\\n\", 'over something which you can neither help no hinder by a minute. See?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s so easy for you to talk in that way. People like what you do. Don\\'t you\\n', 'ever think about the gallery?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Much too often; but I\\'m always punished for it by loss of power. It\\'s as\\n', 'simple as the Rule of Three. If we make light of our work by using it for our\\n', \"own ends, our work will make light of us, and, as we're the weaker, we shall\\n\", 'suffer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t treat my work lightly. You know that it\\'s everything to me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of course; but, whether you realise it or not, you give two strokes for\\n', \"yourself to one for your work. It isn't your fault, darling. I do exactly the\\n\", \"same thing, and know that I'm doing it. Most of the French schools, and all the\\n\", 'schools here, drive the students to work for their own credit, and for the sake\\n', 'of their pride. I was told that all the world was interested in my work, and\\n', \"everybody at Kami's talked turpentine, and I honestly believed that the world\\n\", 'needed elevating and influencing, and all manner of impertinences, by my\\n', 'brushes. By Jove, I actually believed that! When my little head was bursting\\n', \"with a notion that I couldn't handle because I hadn't sufficient knowledge of\\n\", 'my craft, I used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting\\n', 'ready to astonish the world.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But surely one can do that sometimes?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very seldom with malice aforethought, darling. And when it\\'s done it\\'s such a\\n', \"tiny thing, and the world's so big, and all but a millionth part of it doesn't\\n\", \"care. Maisie, come with me and I'll show you something of the size of the\\n\", 'world. One can no more avoid working than eating,--that goes on by itself,--but\\n', 'try to see what you are working for. I know such little heavens that I could\\n', 'take you to,--islands tucked away under the Line. You sight them after weeks of\\n', \"crashing through water as black as black marble because it's so deep, and you\\n\", 'sit in the fore-chains day after day and see the sun rise almost afraid because\\n', 'the sea\\'s so lonely.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Who is afraid?--you, or the sun?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The sun, of course. And there are noises under the sea, and sounds overhead in\\n', 'a clear sky. Then you find your island alive with hot moist orchids that make\\n', 'mouths at you and can do everything except talk.\\n', '\\n', \"There's a waterfall in it three hundred feet high, just like a sliver of green\\n\", 'jade laced with silver; and millions of wild bees live up in the rocks; and you\\n', 'can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms; and you order an ivory-white\\n', 'servant to sling you a long yellow hammock with tassels on it like ripe maize,\\n', 'and you put up your feet and hear the bees hum and the water fall till you go\\n', 'to sleep.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Can one work there?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly. One must do something always. You hang your canvas up in a palm\\n', 'tree and let the parrots criticise. When the scuffle you heave a ripe custard-\\n', 'apple at them, and it bursts in a lather of cream. There are hundreds of\\n', 'places. Come and see them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t quite like that place. It sounds lazy. Tell me another.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you think of a big, red, dead city built of red sandstone, with raw\\n', 'green aloes growing between the stones, lying out neglected on honey-coloured\\n', 'sands? There are forty dead kings there, Maisie, each in a gorgeous tomb finer\\n', 'than all the others. You look at the palaces and streets and shops and tanks,\\n', 'and think that men must live there, till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing\\n', 'its nose all alone in the market-place, and a jewelled peacock struts out of a\\n', 'carved doorway and spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as\\n', 'point-lace. Then a monkey--a little black monkey--walks through the main square\\n', 'to get a drink from a tank forty feet deep. He slides down the creepers to the\\n', 'water\\'s edge, and a friend holds him by the tail, in case he should fall in.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is that all true?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have been there and seen. Then evening comes, and the lights change till\\n', \"it's just as though you stood in the heart of a king-opal. A little before\\n\", 'sundown, as punctually as clockwork, a big bristly wild boar, with all his\\n', 'family following, trots through the city gate, churning the foam on his tusks.\\n', 'You climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god and watch that pig choose\\n', 'himself a palace for the night and stump in wagging his tail. Then the night-\\n', 'wind gets up, and the sands move, and you hear the desert outside the city\\n', \"singing, 'Now I lay me down to sleep,' and everything is dark till the moon\\n\", 'rises. Maisie, darling, come with me and see what the world is really like.\\n', \"It's very lovely, and it's very horrible,--but I won't let you see anything\\n\", \"horrid,--and it doesn't care your life or mine for pictures or anything else\\n\", \"except doing its own work and making love.

Come away!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why?\" said Maisie.\\n', '\\n', '\"How can you do anything until you have seen everything, or as much as you can?\\n', 'And besides, darling, I love you. Come along with me. You have no business\\n', \"here; you don't belong to this place; you're half a gipsy,--your face tells\\n\", 'that; and I--even the smell of open water makes me restless. Come across the\\n', 'sea and be happy!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He had risen to his feet, and stood in the shadow of the gun, looking down at\\n', 'the girl. The very short winter afternoon had worn away, and, before they knew,\\n', 'the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea. Long ruled lines of silver\\n', 'showed where a ripple of the rising tide was turning over the mud-banks. The\\n', 'wind had dropped, and in the intense stillness they could hear a donkey\\n', 'cropping the frosty grass many yards away. A faint beating, like that of a\\n', 'muffled drum, came out of the moon-haze.\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s that?\" said Maisie, quickly. \"It sounds like a heart beating.\\n', 'Where is it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could not\\n', 'trust himself to speak, and in this silence caught the sound. Maisie from her\\n', 'seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of fear.\\n', '\\n', 'She wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry her with over-\\n', 'sea emotion that she both could and could not understand. She was not prepared,\\n', 'however, for the change in his face as he listened.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a steamer,\" he said,--\"a twin-screw steamer, by the beat. I  can\\'t make\\n', 'her out, but she must be standing very close inshore. Ah!\" as the red of a\\n', 'rocket streaked the haze, \"she\\'s standing in to signal before she clears the\\n', 'Channel.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is it a wreck?\" said Maisie, to whom these words were as Greek.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick\\'s eyes were turned to the sea. \"Wreck! What nonsense! She\"s only reporting\\n', \"herself. Red rocket forward--there's a green light aft now, and two red rockets\\n\", 'from the bridge.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What does that mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s the signal of the Cross Keys Line running to Australia. I wonder which\\n', 'steamer it is.\" The note of his voice had changed; he seemed to be talking to\\n', 'himself, and Maisie did not approve of it. The moonlight broke the haze for a\\n', 'moment, touching the black sides of a long steamer working down Channel. \"Four\\n', \"masts and three funnels--she's in deep draught, too. That must be the\\n\", \"Barralong, or the Bhutia. No, the Bhutia has a clipper bow. It's the Barralong,\\n\", \"to Australia. She'll lift the Southern Cross in a week,--lucky old tub!--oh,\\n\", 'lucky old tub!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He stared intently, and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better view,\\n', 'but the mist on the sea thickened again, and the beating of the screws grew\\n', 'fainter. Maisie called to him a little angrily, and he returned, still keeping\\n', 'his eyes to seaward. \"Have you ever seen the Southern Cross blazing right over\\n', 'your head?\" he asked. \"It\"s superb!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No,\" she said shortly, \"and I don\\'t want to. If you think it\\'s so lovely, why\\n', 'don\\'t you go and see it yourself?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about her\\n', 'throat, and her eyes shone like diamonds. The moonlight on the gray kangaroo\\n', 'fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest.\\n', '\\n', '\"By Jove, Maisie, you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there.\" The\\n', 'eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he\\n', 'continued. \"The Southern Cross isn\\'t worth looking at unless someone helps you\\n', 'to see. That steamer\\'s out of hearing.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Dick,\" she said quietly, \"suppose I were to come to you now,--be quiet a\\n', 'minute,--just as I am, and caring for you just as much as I do.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not as a brother, though.

I\"d give ten years of my life to get you what you want. But I\\n', 'can\\'t help you; even I can\\'t help.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A murmur of dissent from Maisie.

And the moonlight came into Maisie's soul, so that she, usually\\n\", 'reserved, chattered of herself and of the things she took interest in,--of\\n', 'Kami, wisest of teachers, and of the girls in the studio,--of the Poles, who\\n', 'will kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked; of the French, who\\n', 'talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish; of the\\n', 'slovenly English, who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that inclination\\n', 'does not imply power; of the Americans, whose rasping voices in the hush of a\\n', 'hot afternoon strain tense-drawn nerves to breaking-point, and whose suppers\\n', 'lead to indigestion; of tempestuous Russians, neither to hold nor to bind, who\\n', 'tell the girls ghost-stories till the girls shriek; of stolid Germans, who come\\n', 'to learn one thing, and, having mastered that much, stolidly go away and copy\\n', 'pictures for evermore. Dick listened enraptured because it was Maisie who\\n', 'spoke. He knew the old life.\\n', '\\n', '\"It hasn\\'t changed much,\" he said. \"Do they still steal colours at lunch-time?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not steal. Attract is the word. Of course they do. I\\'m good--I only attract\\n', 'ultramarine; but there are students who\\'d attract flake-white.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve done it myself. You can\\'t help it when the palettes are hung up.\\n', '\\n', 'Every colour is common property once it runs down,--even though you do start it\\n', 'with a drop of oil. It teaches people not to waste their tubes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should like to attract some of your colours, Dick. Perhaps I might catch\\n', 'your success with them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I mustn\\'t say a bad word, but I should like to. What in the world, which\\n', \"you've just missed a lovely chance of seeing, does success or want of success,\\n\", \"or a three-storied success, matter compared with----No, I won't open that\\n\", 'question again. It\\'s time to go back to town.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m sorry, Dick, but----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re much more interested in that than you are in me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know, I don\\'t think I am.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What will you give me if I tell you a sure short-cut to everything you want,--\\n', 'the trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest? Will you promise to\\n', 'obey me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of course.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In the first place, you must never forget a meal because you happen to be at\\n', 'work. You forgot your lunch twice last week,\" said Dick, at a venture, for he\\n', 'knew with whom he was dealing.\\n', '\\n', '\"No, no,--only once, really.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s bad enough. And you mustn\\'t take a cup of tea and a biscuit in place of\\n', 'a regular dinner, because dinner happens to be a trouble.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re making fun of me!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never was more in earnest in my life. Oh, my love, my love, hasn\\'t it dawned\\n', \"on you yet what you are to me? Here's the whole earth in a conspiracy to give\\n\", 'you a chill, or run over you, or drench you to the skin, or cheat you out of\\n', \"your money, or let you die of overwork and underfeeding, and I haven't the mere\\n\", \"right to look after you.

You\\'ve been cooped up in\\n', \"the schools too long, and you think every one is looking at you. There aren't\\n\", 'twelve hundred people in the world who understand pictures. The others pretend\\n', \"and don't care. Remember, I've seen twelve hundred men dead in toadstool-beds.\\n\", \"It's only the voice of the tiniest little fraction of people that makes\\n\", \"success. The real world doesn't care a tinker's--doesn't care a bit. For aught\\n\", 'you or I know, every man in the world may be arguing with a Maisie of his own.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Poor Maisie!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Poor Dick, I think. Do you believe while he\\'s fighting for what\"s dearer than\\n', 'his life he wants to look at a picture? And even if he did, and if all the\\n', 'world did, and a thousand million people rose up and shouted hymns to my honour\\n', 'and glory, would that make up to me for the knowledge that you were out\\n', \"shopping in the Edgware Road on a rainy day without an umbrella? Now we'll go\\n\", 'to the station.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you said on the beach----\" persisted Maisie, with a certain fear.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick groaned aloud: \"Yes, I know what I said. My work is everything I have, or\\n', \"am, or hope to be, to me, and I believe I've learnt the law that governs it;\\n\", \"but I've some lingering sense of fun left,--though you've nearly knocked it out\\n\", \"of me. I can just see that it isn't everything to all the world. Do what I say,\\n\", 'and not what I do.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters, and they returned to London\\n', 'joyously. The terminus stopped Dick in the midst of an eloquent harangue on the\\n', 'beauties of exercise. He would buy Maisie a horse,--such a horse as never yet\\n', 'bowed head to bit,--would stable it, with a companion, some twenty miles from\\n', \"London, and Maisie, solely for her health's sake should ride with him twice or\\n\", 'thrice a week.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s absurd,\" said she. \"It wouldn\\'t be proper.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Now, who in all London tonight would have sufficient interest or audacity to\\n', 'call us two to account for anything we chose to do?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie looked at the lamps, the fog, and the hideous turmoil. Dick was right;\\n', 'but horseflesh did not make for Art as she understood it.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re very nice sometimes, but you\\'re very foolish more times. I\\'m not going\\n', 'to let you give me horses, or take you out of your way tonight. I\"ll go home by\\n', \"myself. Only I want you to promise me something. You won't think any more about\\n\", \"that extra threepence, will you? Remember, you've been paid; and I won't allow\\n\", 'you to be spiteful and do bad work for a little thing like that. You can be so\\n', 'big that you mustn\\'t be tiny.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was turning the tables with a vengeance. There remained only to put Maisie\\n', 'into her hansom.\\n', '\\n', '\"Goodbye,\" she said simply. \"You\\'ll come on Sunday. It has been a beautiful\\n', 'day, Dick. Why can\\'t it be like this always?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Because love\\'s like line-work: you must go forward or backward; you can\\'t\\n', 'stand still. By the way, go on with your line-work. Good night, and, for my--\\n', 'for my sake, take care of yourself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He turned to walk home, meditating. The day had brought him nothing that he\\n', 'hoped for, but--surely this was worth many days--it had brought him nearer to\\n', 'Maisie. The end was only a question of time now, and the prize well worth the\\n', 'waiting. By instinct, once more, he turned to the river.\\n', '\\n', '\"And she understood at once,\" he said, looking at the water. \"She found out my\\n', 'pet besetting sin on the spot, and paid it off. My God, how she understood! And\\n', 'she said I was better than she was! Better than she was!\" He laughed at the\\n', 'absurdity of the notion. \"I wonder if girls guess at one-half a man\\'s life.\\n', 'They  can\\'t, or--they wouldn\\'t marry us.\" He took her gift out of his pocket,\\n', 'and considered it in the light of a miracle and a pledge of the comprehension\\n', 'that, one day, would lead to perfect happiness. Meantime, Maisie was alone in\\n', 'London, with none to save her from danger. And the packed wilderness was very\\n', 'full of danger.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the heathen as he\\n', 'threw the piece of silver into the river. If any evil were to befal, let him\\n', 'bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed, since the threepenny piece was\\n', 'dearest to him of all his possessions. It was a small coin in itself, but\\n', 'Maisie had given it, and the Thames held it, and surely the Fates would be\\n', 'bribed for this once.\\n', '\\n', 'The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie for the\\n', 'moment. He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his chambers with\\n', 'a strong yearning for some man-talk and tobacco after his first experience of\\n', 'an entire day spent in the society of a woman. There was a stronger desire at\\n', 'his heart when there rose before him an unsolicited vision of the Barralong\\n', 'dipping deep and sailing free for the Southern Cross.\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER VIII\\n', '\\n', ' And these two, as I have told you,\\n', ' Were the friends of Hiawatha,\\n', ' Chibiabos, the musician,\\n', ' And the very strong man, Kwasind.\\n', '          --Hiawatha\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow was paging the last sheets of some manuscript, while the Nilghai, who\\n', 'had come for chess and remained to talk tactics, was reading through the first\\n', 'part, commenting scornfully the while.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s picturesque enough and it\\'s sketchy,\" said he; \"but as a serious\\n', 'consideration of affairs in Eastern Europe, it\\'s not worth much.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s off my hands at any rate. . . .

In it Dick had drawn all manner of moving incidents,\\n', 'experienced by himself or related to him by the others, of all the four corners\\n', \"of the earth. But the wider range of the Nilghai's body and life attracted him\\n\", 'most.

Torpenhow from time to time had added rhymed\\n', 'descriptions, and the whole was a curious piece of art, because Dick decided,\\n', 'having regard to the name of the book which being interpreted means \"naked,\"\\n', 'that it would be wrong to draw the Nilghai with any clothes on, under any\\n', 'circumstances. Consequently the last sketch, representing that much-enduring\\n', 'man calling on the War Office to press his claims to the Egyptian medal, was\\n', \"hardly delicate. He settled himself comfortably on Torpenhow's table and turned\\n\", 'over the pages.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a fortune you would have been to Blake, Nilghai!\" he said. \"There\\'s a\\n', \"succulent pinkness about some of these sketches that's more than life-like.\\n\", '\"The Nilghai surrounded while bathing by the Mahdieh\"--that was founded on\\n', 'fact, eh?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It was very nearly my last bath, you irreverent dauber.

What give a man pains across the\\n', 'head and spots before his eyes, Binkie? Shall us take some liver pills?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick had just gone through a lively scene with Bessie. She had for the fiftieth\\n', 'time reproached him for sending Torpenhow away. She explained her enduring\\n', 'hatred for Dick, and made it clear to him that she only sat for the sake of his\\n', 'money. \"And Mr. Torpenhow\\'s ten times a better man than you,\" she concluded.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is.

It is not pleasant to live in the company of a notion that\\n', 'will not work out, a fox-terrier that cannot talk, and a woman who talks too\\n', 'much. He would have answered, but at that moment there unrolled itself from one\\n', 'corner of the studio a veil, as it were, of the flimsiest gauze. He rubbed his\\n', 'eyes, but the gray haze would not go.\\n', '\\n', '\"This is disgraceful indigestion. Binkie, we will go to a medicine-man. We\\n', \"can't have our eyes interfered with, for by these we get our bread; also\\n\", 'mutton-chop bones for little dogs.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair, and he said\\n', 'nothing till Dick began to describe the gray film in the studio.\\n', '\\n', '\"We all want a little patching and repairing from time to time,\" he chirped.\\n', '\"Like a ship, my dear sir,--exactly like a ship.

I should recommend you\\n', 'to see an oculist. A little patching and repairing from time to time is all we\\n', 'want. An oculist, by all means.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick sought an oculist,--the best in London.

Dick saw the face as it hurried out into the street.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s the writer-type. He has the same modelling of the forehead as Torp. He\\n', 'looks very sick. Probably heard something he didn\\'t like.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Even as he thought, a great fear came upon Dick, a fear that made him hold his\\n', \"breath as he walked into the oculist's waiting room, with the heavy carved\\n\", 'furniture, the dark-green paper, and the sober-hued prints on the wall. He\\n', 'recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches.\\n', '\\n', 'Many people were waiting their turn before him. His eye was caught by a flaming\\n', 'red-and-gold Christmas-carol book. Little children came to that eye-doctor, and\\n', 'they needed large-type amusement.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s idolatrous bad Art,\" he said, drawing the book towards himself.\\n', '\\n', '\"From the anatomy of the angels, it has been made in Germany.\" He opened in\\n', 'mechanically, and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red ink--\\n', '\\n', ' The next good joy that Mary had,\\n', ' It was the joy of three,\\n', ' To see her good Son Jesus Christ\\n', ' Making the blind to see;\\n', ' Making the blind to see, good Lord,\\n', ' And happy we may be.\\n', ' Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost\\n', ' To all eternity!\\n', '\\n', 'Dick read and re-read the verse till his turn came, and the doctor was bending\\n', 'above him seated in an arm-chair. The blaze of the gas-microscope in his eyes\\n', \"made him wince. The doctor's hand touched the scar of the sword-cut on Dick's\\n\", 'head, and Dick explained briefly how he had come by it. When the flame was\\n', \"removed, Dick saw the doctor's face, and the fear came upon him again. The\\n\", 'doctor wrapped himself in a mist of words. Dick caught allusions to \"scar,\"\\n', '\"frontal bone,\" \"optic nerve,\" \"extreme caution,\" and the \"avoidance of mental\\n', 'anxiety.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Verdict?\" he said faintly. \"My business is painting, and I daren\\'t waste time.\\n', 'What do you make of it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Again the whirl of words, but this time they conveyed a meaning.\\n', '\\n', '\"Can you give me anything to drink?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room, and the prisoners often\\n', 'needed cheering. Dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand.\\n', '\\n', '\"As far as I can gather,\" he said, coughing above the spirit, \"you call it\\n', 'decay of the optic nerve, or something, and therefore hopeless. What is my\\n', 'time-limit, avoiding all strain and worry?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps one year.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My God! And if I don\\'t take care of myself?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I really could not say. One cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury\\n', 'inflicted by the sword-cut. The scar is an old one, and--exposure to the strong\\n', 'light of the desert, did you say?--with excessive application to fine work? I\\n', 'really could not say?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg your pardon, but it has come without any warning. If you will let me,\\n', \"I'll sit here for a minute, and then I'll go. You have been very good in\\n\", 'telling me the truth. Without any warning; without any warning. Thanks.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick went into the street, and was rapturously received by Binkie.\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'ve got it very badly, little dog! Just as badly as we can get it. We\\'ll go\\n', 'to the Park to think it out.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They headed for a certain tree that Dick knew well, and they sat down to think,\\n', 'because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear at the pit of\\n', 'his stomach.\\n', '\\n', '\"How could it have come without any warning? It\\'s as sudden as being shot. It\\'s\\n', \"the living death, Binkie. We're to be shut up in the dark in one year if we're\\n\", \"careful, and we shan't see anybody, and we shall never have anything we want,\\n\", 'not though we live to be a hundred!\" Binkie wagged his tail joyously. \"Binkie,\\n', 'we must think. Let\\'s see how it feels to be blind.\" Dick shut his eyes, and\\n', 'flaming commas and Catherine-wheels floated inside the lids. Yet when he looked\\n', 'across the Park the scope of his vision was not contracted. He could see\\n', 'perfectly, until a procession of slow-wheeling fireworks defiled across his\\n', 'eyeballs.\\n', '\\n', '\"Little dorglums, we aren\\'t at all well. Let\\'s go home. If only Torp were back,\\n', 'now!\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Torpenhow was in the south of England, inspecting dockyards in the company\\n', 'of the Nilghai. His letters were brief and full of mystery.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows. He argued,\\n', 'in the loneliness of his studio, henceforward to be decorated with a film of\\n', 'gray gauze in one corner, that, if his fate were blindness, all the Torpenhows\\n', 'in the world could not save him. \"I can\\'t call him off his trip to sit down and\\n', 'sympathise with me. I must pull through this business alone,\" he said. He was\\n', 'lying on the sofa, eating his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the\\n', 'night would be like. Then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the\\n', 'Soudan. A soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broad-bladed Arab spear.\\n', 'For one instant the man felt no pain. Looking down, he saw that his life-blood\\n', 'was going from him. The stupid bewilderment on his face was so intensely comic\\n', 'that both Dick and Torpenhow, still panting and unstrung from a fight for life,\\n', 'had roared with laughter, in which the man seemed as if he would join, but, as\\n', 'his lips parted in a sheepish grin, the agony of death came upon him, and he\\n', 'pitched grunting at their feet. Dick laughed again, remembering the horror. It\\n', 'seemed so exactly like his own case.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I have a little more time allowed me,\" he said. He paced up and down the\\n', 'room, quietly at first, but afterwards with the hurried feet of fear. It was as\\n', 'though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go forward; and there\\n', 'were only weaving circles and floating pin-dots before his eyes.\\n', '\\n', '\"We need to be calm, Binkie; we must be calm.\" He talked aloud for the sake of\\n', 'distraction. \"This isn\\'t nice at all. What shall we do? We must do something.\\n', \"Our time is short. I shouldn't have believed that this morning; but now things\\n\", 'are different. Binkie, where was Moses when the light went out?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Binkie smiled from ear to ear, as a well-bred terrier should, but made no\\n', 'suggestion.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Were there but world enough and time, This coyness, Binkie, were not crime. .\\n', '. . But at my back I always hear----\\'\" He wiped his forehead, which was\\n', 'unpleasantly damp. \"What can I do? What can I do? I haven\\'t any notions left,\\n', \"and I can't think connectedly, but I must do something, or I shall go off my\\n\", 'head.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The hurried walk recommenced, Dick stopping every now and again to drag forth\\n', 'long-neglected canvases and old note-books; for he turned to his work by\\n', 'instinct, as a thing that could not fail. \"You won\\'t do, and you won\\'t do,\" he\\n', 'said, at each inspection. \"No more soldiers. I couldn\\'t paint \\'em. Sudden death\\n', 'comes home too nearly, and this is battle and murder for me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The day was failing, and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight of the\\n', 'blind had come upon him unaware. \"Allah Almighty!\" he cried despairingly, \"help\\n', \"me through the time of waiting, and I won't whine when my punishment comes.\\n\", 'What can I do now, before the light goes?\"\\n', '\\n', 'There was no answer. Dick waited till he could regain some sort of control over\\n', 'himself. His hands were shaking, and he prided himself on their steadiness; he\\n', 'could feel that his lips were quivering, and the sweat was running down his\\n', 'face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward by the desire to get to work at\\n', 'once and accomplish something, and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do\\n', 'more than repeat the news that he was about to go blind. \"It\\'s a humiliating\\n', 'exhibition,\" he thought, \"and I\\'m glad Torp isn\\'t here to see. The doctor said\\n', 'I was to avoid mental worry. Come here and let me pet you, Binkie.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him.\\n', '\\n', 'Then he heard the man speaking in the twilight, and, doglike, understood that\\n', 'his trouble stood off from him--\"Allah is good, Binkie. Not quite so gentle as\\n', \"we could wish, but we'll discuss that later. I think I see my way to it now.\\n\", \"All those studies of Bessie's head were nonsense, and they nearly brought your\\n\", \"master into a scrape. I hold the notion now as clear as crystal, 'the\\n\", \"Melancolia that transcends all wit.' There shall be Maisie in that head,\\n\", 'because I shall never get Maisie; and Bess, of course, because she knows all\\n', \"about Melancolia, though she doesn't know she knows; and there shall be some\\n\", \"drawing in it, and it shall all end up with a laugh. That's for myself. Shall\\n\", 'she giggle or grin? No, she shall laugh right out of the canvas, and every man\\n', 'and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shall--what is it the poem says?-\\n', '-\\n', '\\n', \"'Understand the speech and feel a stir\\n\", \" Of fellowship in all disastrous fight.'\\n\", '\\n', '\"\\'In all disastrous fight\\'? That\\'s better than painting the thing merely to\\n', \"pique Maisie. I can do it now because I have it inside me. Binkie, I'm going to\\n\", 'hold you up by your tail. You\\'re an omen. Come here.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking.\\n', '\\n', '\"Rather like holding a guinea-pig; but you\\'re a brave little dog, and you don\\'t\\n', 'yelp when you\\'re hung up. It is an omen.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Binkie went to his own chair, and as often as he looked saw Dick walking up and\\n', 'down, rubbing his hands and chuckling. That night Dick wrote a letter to Maisie\\n', 'full of the tenderest regard for her health, but saying very little about his\\n', 'own, and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born. Not till morning did he remember\\n', 'that something might happen to him in the future.\\n', '\\n', 'He fell to work, whistling softly, and was swallowed up in the clean, clear joy\\n', 'of creation, which does not come to man too often, lest he should consider\\n', 'himself the equal of his God, and so refuse to die at the appointed time. He\\n', 'forgot Maisie, Torpenhow, and Binkie at his feet, but remembered to stir\\n', 'Bessie, who needed very little stirring, into a tremendous rage, that he might\\n', 'watch the smouldering lights in her eyes.\\n', '\\n', 'He threw himself without reservation into his work, and did not think of the\\n', 'doom that was to overtake him, for he was possessed with his notion, and the\\n', 'things of this world had no power upon him.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re pleased today,\" said Bessie.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick waved his mahl-stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for a\\n', 'drink. In the evening, when the exaltation of the day had died down, he went to\\n', 'the sideboard again, and after some visits became convinced that the eye-doctor\\n', 'was a liar, since he could still see everything very clearly.\\n', '\\n', 'He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie, and that whether\\n', 'she liked it or not she should be his wife. The mood passed next morning, but\\n', 'the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort.\\n', '\\n', 'Again he set to work, and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and blurs\\n', 'till he had taken counsel with the sideboard, and the Melancolia both on the\\n', 'canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever. There was a delightful\\n', 'sense of irresponsibility upon him, such as they feel who walking among their\\n', 'fellow-men know that the death-sentence of disease is upon them, and, seeing\\n', 'that fear is but waste of the little time left, are riotously happy. The days\\n', 'passed without event.\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie arrived punctually always, and, though her voice seemed to Dick to come\\n', 'from a distance, her face was always very near. The Melancolia began to flame\\n', 'on the canvas, in the likeness of a woman who had known all the sorrow in the\\n', 'world and was laughing at it. It was true that the corners of the studio draped\\n', 'themselves in gray film and retired into the darkness, that the spots in his\\n', \"eyes and the pains across his head were very troublesome, and that Maisie's\\n\", 'letters were hard to read and harder still to answer. He could not tell her of\\n', 'his trouble, and he could not laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which\\n', 'was always going to be finished. But the furious days of toil and the nights of\\n', 'wild dreams made amends for all, and the sideboard was his best friend on\\n', 'earth.\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie was singularly dull. She used to shriek with rage when Dick stared at\\n', 'her between half-closed eyes. Now she sulked, or watched him with disgust,\\n', 'saying very little.\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks. An incoherent note heralded his\\n', 'return. \"News! great news!\" he wrote. \"The Nilghai knows, and so does the\\n', 'Keneu. We\\'re all back on Thursday. Get lunch and clean your accoutrements.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick showed Bessie the letter, and she abused him for that he had ever sent\\n', 'Torpenhow away and ruined her life.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well,\" said Dick, brutally, \"you\\'re better as you are, instead of making love\\n', 'to some drunken beast in the street.\" He felt that he had rescued Torpenhow\\n', 'from great temptation.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know if that\\'s any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a studio.\\n', \"You haven't been sober for three weeks. You've been soaking the whole time; and\\n\", 'yet you pretend you\\'re better than me!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What d\\'you mean?\" said Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mean! You\\'ll see when Mr. Torpenhow comes back.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was not long to wait. Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a sign\\n', 'of feeling. He had news that was more to him than many Bessies, and the Keneu\\n', 'and the Nilghai were trampling behind him, calling for Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"Drinking like a fish,\" Bessie whispered. \"He\\'s been at it for nearly a month.\"\\n', 'She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done.\\n', '\\n', 'They came into the studio, rejoicing, to be welcomed over effusively by a\\n', 'drawn, lined, shrunken, haggard wreck,--unshaven, blue-white about the\\n', 'nostrils, stooping in the shoulders, and peering under his eyebrows nervously.\\n', 'The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is this you?\" said Torpenhow.\\n', '\\n', '\"All that\\'s left of me. Sit down. Binkie\\'s quite well, and I\\'ve been doing some\\n', 'good work.\" He reeled where he stood.\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'ve done some of the worst work you\\'ve ever done in your life. Man alive,\\n', 'you\\'re----\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly, and they left the room to find\\n', 'lunch elsewhere. Then he spoke; but, since the reproof of a friend is much too\\n', 'sacred and intimate a thing to be printed, and since Torpenhow used figures and\\n', 'metaphors which were unseemly, and contempt untranslatable, it will never be\\n', 'known what was actually said to Dick, who blinked and winked and picked at his\\n', 'hands. After a time the culprit began to feel the need of a little self-\\n', 'respect. He was quite sure that he had not in any way departed from virtue, and\\n', 'there were reasons, too, of which Torpenhow knew nothing. He would explain.\\n', '\\n', 'He rose, tried to straighten his shoulders, and spoke to the face he could\\n', 'hardly see.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are right,\" he said. \"But I am right, too. After you went away I had some\\n', 'trouble with my eyes. So I went to an oculist, and he turned a gasogene--I mean\\n', \"a gas-engine--into my eye. That was very long ago. He said, 'Scar on the head,-\\n\", \"-sword-cut and optic nerve.' Make a note of that. So I am going blind. I have\\n\", 'some work to do before I go blind, and I suppose that I must do it. I cannot\\n', 'see much now, but I can see best when I am drunk. I did not know I was drunk\\n', 'till I was told, but I must go on with my work. If you want to see it, there it\\n', 'is.\" He pointed to the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause.\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow said nothing, and Dick began to whimper feebly, for joy at seeing\\n', 'Torpenhow again, for grief at misdeeds--if indeed they were misdeeds--that made\\n', 'Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic, and for childish vanity hurt, since\\n', 'Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his wonderful picture.\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause, and saw the two walking\\n', 'up and down as usual, Torpenhow\\'s hand on Dick\"s shoulder.\\n', '\\n', 'Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie, who was\\n', 'dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master again.\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER XI\\n', '\\n', 'The lark will make her hymn to God,\\n', 'The partridge call her brood,\\n', 'While I forget the heath I trod,\\n', 'The fields wherein I stood.\\n', '\\n', \"'Tis dule to know not night from morn,\\n\", 'But deeper dule to know\\n', \"I can but hear the hunter's horn\\n\", 'That once I used to blow.\\n', '        --The Only Son\\n', '\\n', \"IT WAS the third day after Torpenhow's return, and his heart was heavy.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Do you mean to tell me that you can\\'t see to work without whiskey?

I give you three days; but you\\'re nearly breaking my heart.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick returned to his work, toiling as one possessed; and the yellow devil of\\n', 'whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes. The Melancolia was\\n', 'nearly finished, and was all or nearly all that he had hoped she would be.

It\\'s a French\\n', \"trick, and you wouldn't understand; but it's got at by slewing round the head a\\n\", 'trifle, and a tiny, tiny foreshortening of one side of the face from the angle\\n', 'of the chin to the top of the left ear. That, and deepening the shadow under\\n', 'the lobe of the ear. It was flagrant trick-work; but, having the notion fixed,\\n', 'I felt entitled to play with it,--Oh, you beauty!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Amen! She is a beauty. I can feel it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"So will every man who has any sorrow of his own,\" said Dick, slapping his\\n', 'thigh. \"He shall see his trouble there, and, by the Lord Harry, just when he\\'s\\n', 'feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his head and laugh,--as\\n', \"she is laughing. I've put the life of my heart and the light of my eyes into\\n\", \"her, and I don't care what comes. . . . I'm tired,--awfully tired. I think I'll\\n\", 'get to sleep. Take away the whiskey, it has served its turn, and give Bessie\\n', 'thirty-six quid, and three over for luck. Cover the picture.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He dropped asleep in the long chair, hid face white and haggard, almost before\\n', 'he had finished the sentence. Bessie tried to take Torpenhow\"s hand. \"Aren\\'t\\n', 'you never going to speak to me any more?\" she said; but Torpenhow was looking\\n', 'at Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a stock of vanity the man has! I\\'ll take him in hand tomorrow and make\\n', 'much of him. He deserves it.--Eh! what was that, Bess?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing. I\\'ll put things tidy here a little, and then I\\'ll go. You couldn\\'t\\n', 'give the that three months\" pay now, could you? He said you were to.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms. Bessie faithfully tidied\\n', 'up the studio, set the door ajar for flight, emptied half a bottle of\\n', 'turpentine on a duster, and began to scrub the face of the Melancolia\\n', 'viciously. The paint did not smudge quickly enough. She took a palette-knife\\n', 'and scraped, following each stroke with the wet duster. In five minutes the\\n', 'picture was a formless, scarred muddle of colours. She threw the paint-stained\\n', 'duster into the studio stove, stuck out her tongue at the sleeper, and\\n', 'whispered, \"Bilked!\" as she turned to run down the staircase. She would never\\n', 'see Torpenhow any more, but she had at least done harm to the man who had come\\n', 'between her and her desire and who used to make fun of her. Cashing the check\\n', 'was the very cream of the jest to Bessie. Then the little privateer sailed\\n', 'across the Thames, to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of South-the-\\n', 'Water.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick slept till late in the evening, when Torpenhow dragged him off to bed. His\\n', 'eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse. \"Let\\'s have another look at the\\n', 'picture,\" he said, insistently as a child.\\n', '\\n', '\"You--go--to--bed,\" said Torpenhow. \"You aren\\'t at all well, though you mayn\\'t\\n', 'know it. You\\'re as jumpy as a cat.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I reform tomorrow. Good night.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As he repassed through the studio, Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the\\n', 'picture, and almost betrayed himself by outcries: \"Wiped out!--scraped out and\\n', \"turped out! He's on the verge of jumps as it is. That's Bess,--the little\\n\", 'fiend! Only a woman could have done that!--with the ink not dry on the check,\\n', 'too! Dick will be raving mad tomorrow. It was all my fault for trying to help\\n', 'gutter-devils. Oh, my poor Dick, the Lord is hitting you very hard!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick could not sleep that night, partly for pure joy, and partly because the\\n', 'well-known Catherine-wheels inside his eyes had given place to crackling\\n', 'volcanoes of many-coloured fire. \"Spout away,\" he said aloud.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve done my work, and now you can do what you please.\" He lay still, staring\\n', 'at the ceiling, the long-pent-up delirium of drink in his veins, his brain on\\n', 'fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be considered, and his hands\\n', 'crisped and dry. He had just discovered that he was painting the face of the\\n', 'Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with millions of lights, and that all his\\n', 'wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging\\n', 'plank, shouting together in his honour, when something cracked inside his\\n', 'temples like an overstrained bowstring, the glittering dome broke inward, and\\n', 'he was alone in the thick night.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ll go to sleep. The room\\'s very dark. Let\\'s light a lamp and see how the\\n', 'Melancolia looks. There ought to have been a moon.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was then that Torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did not\\n', 'know,--in the rattling accents of deadly fear.\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'s looked at the picture,\" was his first thought, as he hurried into the\\n', 'bedroom and found Dick sitting up and beating the air with his hands.\\n', '\\n', '\"Torp! Torp! where are you? For pity\\'s sake, come to me!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick clutched at his shoulder. \"Matter! I\\'ve been lying here for hours in the\\n', \"dark, and you never heard me. Torp, old man, don't go away. I'm all in the\\n\", 'dark. In the dark, I tell you!\"\\n', '\\n', \"Torpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dick's eyes, but there was no light\\n\", 'in those eyes. He lit the gas, and Dick heard the flame catch. The grip of his\\n', \"fingers on Torpenhow's shoulder made Torpenhow wince.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Don\\'t leave me. You wouldn\\'t leave me alone now, would you? I  can\\'t see.\\n', \"D'you understand? It's black,--quite black,--and I feel as if I was falling\\n\", 'through it all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Steady does it.\" Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock him gently\\n', 'to and fro.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s good. Now don\\'t talk. If I keep very quiet for a while, this darkness\\n', 'will lift. It seems just on the point of breaking. H\\'sh!\" Dick knit his brows\\n', \"and stared desperately in front of him. The night air was chilling Torpenhow's\\n\", 'toes.\\n', '\\n', '\"Can you stay like that a minute?\" he said. \"I\\'ll get my dressing-gown and some\\n', 'slippers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick clutched the bed-head with both hands and waited for the darkness to clear\\n', 'away. \"What a time you\\'ve been!\" he cried, when Torpenhow returned. \"It\\'s as\\n', 'black as ever. What are you banging about in the door-way?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Long chair,--horse-blanket,--pillow. Going to sleep by you. Lie down now;\\n', 'you\\'ll be better in the morning.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I shan\\'t!\" The voice rose to a wail. \"My God! I\\'m blind! I\\'m blind, and the\\n', 'darkness will never go away.\" He made as if to leap from the bed, but\\n', \"Torpenhow's arms were round him, and Torpenhow's chin was on his shoulder, and\\n\", 'his breath was squeezed out of him. He could only gasp, \"Blind!\" and wriggle\\n', 'feebly.\\n', '\\n', '\"Steady, Dickie, steady!\" said the deep voice in his ear, and the grip\\n', 'tightened. \"Bite on the bullet, old man, and don\\'t let them think you\"re\\n', 'afraid.\" The grip could draw no closer. Both men were breathing heavily.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned.\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me go,\" he panted. \"You\\'re cracking my ribs. We--we mustn\\'t let them think\\n', 'we\\'re afraid, must we,--all the powers of darkness and that lot?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lie down. It\\'s all over now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes,\" said Dick, obediently. \"But would you mind letting me hold your hand? I\\n', 'feel as if I wanted something to hold on to. One drops through the dark so.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair. Dick clutched\\n', 'it tightly, and in half an hour had fallen asleep. Torpenhow withdrew his hand,\\n', 'and, stooping over Dick, kissed him lightly on the forehead, as men do\\n', 'sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death, to ease his departure.\\n', '\\n', 'In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself. He was adrift on the\\n', 'shoreless tides of delirium, speaking very quickly--\"It\\'s a pity,--a great\\n', \"pity; but it's helped, and it must be eaten, Master George. Sufficient unto the\\n\", 'day is the blindness thereof, and, further, putting aside all Melancolias and\\n', 'false humours, it is of obvious notoriety--such as mine was--that the queen can\\n', \"do no wrong. Torp doesn't know that. I'll tell him when we're a little farther\\n\", 'into the desert.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamer-ropes!

How good that looks!\\n', \"I'll sketch it. No, I can't. I'm afflicted with ophthalmia. That was one of the\\n\", 'ten plagues of Egypt, and it extends up the Nile in the shape of cataract. Ha!\\n', \"that's a joke, Torp. Laugh, you graven image, and stand clear of the hawser. .\\n\", '. . It\\'ll knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty, Maisie dear.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh!\" said Torpenhow. \"This happened before.

My right\\n\", 'hand, if it would serve.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Now we mustn\\'t listen. Here\\'s an island shouting across seas of\\n', 'misunderstanding with a vengeance. But it\\'s shouting truth, I fancy,\" said\\n', 'Torpenhow.\\n', '\\n', 'The babble continued. It all bore upon Maisie. Sometimes Dick lectured at\\n', 'length on his craft, then he cursed himself for his folly in being enslaved. He\\n', 'pleaded to Maisie for a kiss--only one kiss--before she went away, and called\\n', 'to her to come back from Vitry-sur-Marne, if she would; but through all his\\n', 'ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that the queen could do no wrong.\\n', '\\n', \"Torpenhow listened attentively, and learned every detail of Dick's life that\\n\", 'had been hidden from him. For three days Dick raved through the past, and then\\n', 'a natural sleep. \"What a strain he has been running under, poor chap!\" said\\n', 'Torpenhow. \"Dick, of all men, handing himself over like a dog! And I was\\n', 'lecturing him on arrogance! I ought to have known that it was no use to judge a\\n', \"man. But I did it. What a demon that girl must be!

You\\'ve been here too long.\\n', 'I\\'ll get up. Hi! This is annoying. I can\\'t dress myself. Oh, it\\'s too absurd!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the\\n', 'studio. He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to lift.\\n', 'It did not lift that day, nor the next. Dick adventured on a voyage round the\\n', 'walls. He hit his shins against the stove, and this suggested to him that it\\n', 'would be better to crawl on all fours, one hand in front of him. Torpenhow\\n', 'found him on the floor.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m trying to get the geography of my new possessions,\" said he. \"D\"you\\n', \"remember that nigger you gouged in the square? Pity you didn't keep the odd\\n\", 'eye. It would have been useful. Any letters for me? Give me all the ones in fat\\n', 'gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside. They\\'re of no importance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M. on the envelope flap. Dick put it\\n', 'into his pocket. There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might not have read,\\n', 'but it belonged to himself and to Maisie, who would never belong to him.\\n', '\\n', '\"When she finds that I don\\'t write, she\\'ll stop writing. It\\'s better so. I\\n', 'couldn\\'t be any use to her now,\" Dick argued, and the tempter suggested that he\\n', 'should make known his condition. Every nerve in him revolted. \"I have fallen\\n', \"low enough already. I'm not going to beg for pity. Besides, it would be cruel\\n\", 'to her.\" He strove to put Maisie out of his thoughts; but the blind have many\\n', 'opportunities for thinking, and as the tides of his strength came back to him\\n', \"in the long employless days of dead darkness, Dick's soul was troubled to the\\n\", 'core. Another letter, and another, came from Maisie. Then there was silence,\\n', 'and Dick sat by the window, the pulse of summer in the air, and pictured her\\n', 'being won by another man, stronger than himself. His imagination, the keener\\n', 'for the dark background it worked against, spared him no single detail that\\n', 'might send him raging up and down the studio, to stumble over the stove that\\n', 'seemed to be in four places at once. Worst of all, tobacco would not taste in\\n', 'the darkness. The arrogance of the man had disappeared, and in its place were\\n', 'settled despair that Torpenhow knew, and blind passion that Dick confided to\\n', 'his pillow at night. The intervals between the paroxysms were filled with\\n', 'intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness.\\n', '\\n', '\"Come out into the Park,\" said Torpenhow. \"You haven\\'t stirred out since the\\n', 'beginning of things.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the use? There\\'s no movement in the dark; and, besides,\"--he paused\\n', 'irresolutely at the head of the stairs,--\"something will run over me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not if I\\'m with you. Proceed gingerly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror, and he clung to\\n', 'Torpenhow\\'s arm. \"Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot!\" he said\\n', 'petulantly, as he turned into the Park. \"Let\\'s curse God and die.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments. By Jove, there are the\\n', 'Guards!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick\\'s figure straightened. \"Let\\'s get near \"em. Let\\'s go in and look. Let\"s\\n', 'get on the grass and run. I can smell the trees.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mind the low railing. That\\'s all right!\" Torpenhow kicked out a tuft of grass\\n', 'with his heel. \"Smell that,\" he said. \"Isn\\'t it good?\" Dick sniffed\\n', 'luxuriously. \"Now pick up your feet and run.\" They approached as near to the\\n', \"regiment as was possible.

How did you know?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Felt it. Oh, my men!--my beautiful men!\" He edged forward as though he could\\n', 'see. \"I could draw those chaps once. Who\\'ll draw \\'em now?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ll move off in a minute. Don\\'t jump when the band begins.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Huh! I\\'m not a new charger. It\\'s the silences that hurt. Nearer, Torp!--\\n', \"nearer! Oh, my God, what wouldn't I give to see 'em for a minute!--one half-\\n\", 'minute!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him, could hear the slings\\n', \"tighten across the bandsman's chest as he heaved the big drum from the ground.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Sticks crossed above his head,\" whispered Torpenhow.\\n', '\\n', '\"I know. I know! Who should know if I don\\'t? H\\'sh!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The drum-sticks fell with a boom, and the men swung forward to the crash of the\\n', 'band. Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face, heard the\\n', 'maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts. The big\\n', 'drum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall refrain that made a perfect\\n', 'quickstep--\\n', '\\n', '\"He must be a man of decent height,\\n', 'He must be a man of weight,\\n', 'He must come home on a Saturday night\\n', 'In a thoroughly sober state;\\n', 'He must know how to love me,\\n', 'And he must know how to kiss;\\n', \"And if he's enough to keep us both\\n\", 'I can\\'t refuse him bliss.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Torpenhow, as he saw Dick\\'s head fall when the last\\n', 'of the regiment had departed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing.

Don\\'t think I\\'m ungrateful; but I\\'m best\\n', 'alone.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Nilghai chuckled, and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen rebellion\\n', 'against fate. He had long since ceased to think about the work he had done in\\n', 'the old days, and the desire to do more work had departed from him. He was\\n', 'exceedingly sorry for himself, and the completeness of his tender grief soothed\\n', 'him. But his soul and his body cried for Maisie--Maisie who would understand.\\n', 'His mind pointed out that Maisie, having her own work to do, would not care.\\n', 'His experience had taught him that when money was exhausted women went away,\\n', 'and that when a man was knocked out of the race the others trampled on him.\\n', '\"Then at the least,\" said Dick, in reply, \"she could use me as I used Binat,--\\n', \"for some sort of a study. I wouldn't ask more than to be near her again, even\\n\", 'though I knew that another man was making love to her. Ugh! what a dog I am!\"\\n', '\\n', 'A voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully--\\n', '\\n', '\"When we go--go--go away from here,\\n', 'Our creditors will weep and they will wail,\\n', \"Our absence much regretting when they find that we've been getting\\n\", 'Out of England by next Tuesday\\'s Indian mail.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Following the trampling of feet, slamming of Torpenhow's door, and the sound of\\n\", 'voices in strenuous debate, some one squeaked, \"And see, you good fellows, I\\n', \"have found a new water-bottle--firs'-class patent--eh, how you say? Open\\n\", 'himself inside out.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick sprang to his feet. He knew the voice well. \"That\\'s Cassavetti, come back\\n', \"from the Continent. Now I know why Torp went away. There's a row somewhere,\\n\", 'and--I\\'m out of it!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Nilghai commanded silence in vain. \"That\\'s for my sake,\" Dick said\\n', 'bitterly. \"The birds are getting ready to fly, and they wouldn\\'t tell me. I can\\n', 'hear Morten-Sutherland and Mackaye. Half the War Correspondents in London are\\n', 'there;--and I\\'m out of it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He stumbled across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow\"s room. He could feel\\n', 'that it was full of men. \"Where\\'s the trouble?\" said he. \"In the Balkans at\\n', 'last? Why didn\\'t some one tell me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We thought you wouldn\\'t be interested,\" said the Nilghai, shamefacedly.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s in the Soudan, as usual.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You lucky dogs! Let me sit here while you talk. I shan\\'t be a skeleton at the\\n', 'feast.--Cassavetti, where are you? Your English is as bad as ever.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was led into a chair. He heard the rustle of the maps, and the talk swept\\n', 'forward, carrying him with it. Everybody spoke at once, discussing press\\n', 'censorships, railway-routes, transport, water-supply, the capacities of\\n', 'generals,--these in language that would have horrified a trusting public,--\\n', 'ranting, asserting, denouncing, and laughing at the top of their voices. There\\n', 'was the glorious certainty of war in the Soudan at any moment. The Nilghai said\\n', 'so, and it was well to be in readiness. The Keneu had telegraphed to Cairo for\\n', 'horses; Cassavetti had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would\\n', 'be ordered forward, and was reading it out amid profane interruptions, and the\\n', 'Keneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who would be employed as war artist\\n', 'by the Central Southern Syndicate. \"It\\'s his first outing,\" said the Keneu.\\n', '\"Give him some tips--about riding camels.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, those camels!\" groaned Cassavetti. \"I shall learn to ride him again, and\\n', 'now I am so much all soft! Listen, you good fellows. I know your military\\n', 'arrangement very well. There will go the Royal Argalshire Sutherlanders.

He\\'s off love-making somewhere, I suppose,\" said\\n', 'the Nilghai.\\n', '\\n', '\"He said he was going to stay at home,\" said the Keneu.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is he?\" said Dick, with an oath. \"He won\\'t.

The grass was dry-burnt in the meadows, the clay by the bank of\\n', 'the river was caked to brick, the roadside flowers were long since dead, and\\n', 'the roses in the garden hung withered on their stalks. The heat in the little\\n', 'low bedroom under the eaves was almost intolerable. The very moonlight on the\\n', \"wall of Kami's studio across the road seemed to make the night hotter, and the\\n\", 'shadow of the big bell-handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that\\n', \"caught Maisie's eye and annoyed her.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Horrid thing! It should be all white,\" she murmured. \"And the gate isn\\'t in\\n', 'the middle of the wall, either. I never noticed that before.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie was hard to please at that hour. First, the heat of the past few weeks\\n', 'had worn her down; secondly, her work, and particularly the study of a female\\n', 'head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished in time for the\\n', 'Salon, was unsatisfactory; thirdly, Kami had said as much two days before;\\n', 'fourthly,--but so completely fourthly that it was hardly worth thinking about,-\\n', '-Dick, her property, had not written to her for more than six weeks. She was\\n', 'angry with the heat, with Kami, and with her work, but she was exceedingly\\n', 'angry with Dick.\\n', '\\n', 'She had written to him three times,--each time proposing a fresh treatment of\\n', 'her Melancolia. Dick had taken no notice of these communications. She had\\n', 'resolved to write no more. When she returned to England in the autumn--for her\\n', \"pride's sake she could not return earlier--she would speak to him. She missed\\n\", 'the Sunday afternoon conferences more than she cared to admit. All that Kami\\n', 'said was, \"Continuez, mademoiselle, continuez toujours,\" and he had been\\n', 'repeating the wearisome counsel through the hot summer, exactly like a cicada,-\\n', '-an old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat, white trousers, and a huge felt\\n', 'hat.\\n', '\\n', 'But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north of the\\n', 'cool green London park, and had said things ten times worse than continuez,\\n', 'before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her where the error\\n', 'lay. His last letter, Maisie remembered, contained some trivial advice about\\n', 'not sketching in the sun or drinking water at wayside farmhouses; and he had\\n', 'said that not once, but three times,--as if he did not know that Maisie could\\n', 'take care of herself.\\n', '\\n', 'But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write? A murmur of voices\\n', 'in the road made her lean from the window. A cavalryman of the little garrison\\n', \"in the town was talking to Kami's cook.

He slid his arm round her waist, and there followed the sound\\n\", 'of a kiss.\\n', '\\n', '\"Faugh!\" said Maisie, stepping back.\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s that?\" said the red-haired girl, who was tossing uneasily outside her\\n', 'bed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Only a conscript kissing the cook,\" said Maisie.\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ve gone away now.\" She leaned out of the window again, and put a shawl\\n', 'over her nightgown to guard against chills. There was a very small night-breeze\\n', 'abroad, and a sun-baked rose below nodded its head as one who knew unutterable\\n', 'secrets. Was it possible that Dick should turn his thoughts from her work and\\n', 'his own and descend to the degradation of Suzanne and the conscript? He could\\n', 'not! The rose nodded its head and one leaf therewith. It looked like a naughty\\n', 'little devil scratching its ear.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick could not, \"because,\" thought Maisie, \"he is mine,--mine,--mine.

There was no\\n', 'earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose, except that he\\n', 'was called by Providence, which was Maisie, to assist Maisie in her work. And\\n', 'her work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes to English\\n', 'provincial exhibitions, as the notices in the scrap-book proved, and that were\\n', 'invariably rejected by the Salon when Kami was plagued into allowing her to\\n', 'send them up. Her work in the future, it seemed, would be the preparation of\\n', 'pictures on exactly similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same\\n', 'way----The red-haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets. \"It\\'s too\\n', 'hot to sleep,\" she moaned; and the interruption jarred.\\n', '\\n', 'Exactly the same way. Then she would divide her years between the little studio\\n', \"in England and Kami's big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No, she would go to\\n\", 'another master, who should force her into the success that was her right, if\\n', 'patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to anything. Dick had\\n', 'told her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft. She had worked\\n', 'ten years, and ten years were nothing. Dick had said that ten years were\\n', 'nothing,--but that was in regard to herself only. He had said--this very man\\n', 'who could not find time to write--that he would wait ten years for her, and\\n', 'that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later. He had said this in the\\n', 'absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria; and then he had stopped writing.\\n', 'He was wandering up and down moonlit streets, kissing cooks. She would like to\\n', 'lecture him now,--not in her nightgown, of course, but properly dressed,\\n', 'severely and from a height. Yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly\\n', 'would not care whether she lecture him or not. He would laugh at her. Very\\n', 'good.\\n', '\\n', 'She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went, etc., etc.\\n', '\\n', 'The mill-wheel of thought swung round slowly, that no section of it might be\\n', 'slurred over, and the red-haired girl tossed and turned behind her.\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt\\n', 'whatever of the villainy of Dick.

And he\\n', 'kissed her,--kissed her on the cheek,--by a yellow sea-poppy that nodded its\\n', 'head exactly like the maddening dry rose in the garden. Then there was an\\n', 'interval, and men had told her that they loved her--just when she was busiest\\n', 'with her work. Then the boy came back, and at their very second meeting had\\n', 'told her that he loved her. Then he had----But there was no end to the things\\n', 'he had done. He had given her his time and his powers. He had spoken to her of\\n', 'Art, housekeeping, technique, teacups, the abuse of pickles as a stimulant,--\\n', 'that was rude,--sable hair-brushes,--he had given her the best in her stock,--\\n', 'she used them daily; he had given her advice that she profited by, and now and\\n', 'again--a look. Such a look! The look of a beaten hound waiting for the word to\\n', \"crawl to his mistress's feet. In return she had given him nothing whatever,\\n\", 'except--here she brushed her mouth against the open-work sleeve of her\\n', 'nightgown--the privilege of kissing her once. And on the mouth, too.\\n', 'Disgraceful! Was that not enough, and more than enough? and if it was not, had\\n', 'he not cancelled the debt by not writing and--probably kissing other girls?\\n', '\"Maisie, you\\'ll catch a chill. Do go and lie down,\" said the wearied voice of\\n', 'her companion. \"I can\\'t sleep a wink with you at the window.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. She was reflecting on the\\n', 'meannesses of Dick, and on other meannesses with which he had nothing to do.\\n', 'The moonlight would not let her sleep. It lay on the skylight of the studio\\n', 'across the road in cold silver; she stared at it intently and her thoughts\\n', 'began to slide one into the other. The shadow of the big bell-handle in the\\n', 'wall grew short, lengthened again, and faded out as the moon went down behind\\n', 'the pasture and a hare came limping home across the road. Then the dawn-wind\\n', 'washed through the upland grasses, and brought coolness with it, and the cattle\\n', \"lowed by the drought-shrunk river.

You\\'ll catch a chill.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, dear; yes, dear.\" She staggered to her bed like a wearied child, and as\\n', 'she buried her face in the pillows she muttered, \"I think--I think--But he\\n', 'ought to have written.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Day brought the routine of the studio, the smell of paint and turpentine, and\\n', 'the monotone wisdom of Kami, who was a leaden artist, but a golden teacher if\\n', 'the pupil were only in sympathy with him. Maisie was not in sympathy that day,\\n', 'and she waited impatiently for the end of the work.\\n', '\\n', 'She knew when it was coming; for Kami would gather his black alpaca coat into a\\n', 'bunch behind him, and, with faded flue eyes that saw neither pupils nor canvas,\\n', 'look back into the past to recall the history of one Binat. \"You have all done\\n', 'not so badly,\" he would say. \"But you shall remember that it is not enough to\\n', 'have the method, and the art, and the power, nor even that which is touch, but\\n', 'you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall.

Dick Heldar is my best friend, and--and--the\\n', 'fact is that he has gone blind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Blind!\" said Maisie, stupidly. \"He can\\'t be blind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He has been stone-blind for nearly two months.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie lifted up her face, and it was pearly white. \"No! No! Not blind! I won\\'t\\n', 'have him blind!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Would you care to see for yourself?\" said Torpenhow.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now,--at once?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, no!

Dick wouldn\\'t do that sort of thing. He\\'s sitting in his\\n', 'studio, turning over some letters that he can\\'t read because he\"s blind.\"\\n', '\\n', 'There was a sound of choking from the sun-hat. Maisie bowed her head and went\\n', 'into the cottage, where the red-haired girl was on a sofa, complaining of a\\n', 'headache.\\n', '\\n', '\"Dick\\'s blind!\" said Maisie, taking her breath quickly as she steadied herself\\n', 'against a chair-back. \"My Dick\\'s blind!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What?\" The girl was on the sofa no longer.\\n', '\\n', '\"A man has come from England to tell me.

She\\n', 'returned to the red-haired girl, who was weeping bitterly, and between tears,\\n', 'kisses,--very few of those,--menthol, packing, and an interview with Kami, the\\n', 'sultry afternoon wore away.\\n', '\\n', 'Thought might come afterwards. Her present duty was to go to Dick,--Dick who\\n', 'owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her unopened\\n', 'letters.\\n', '\\n', '\"But what will you do,\" she said to her companion.\\n', '\\n', '\"I? Oh, I shall stay here and--finish your Melancolia,\" she said, smiling\\n', 'pitifully. \"Write to me afterwards.\"\\n', '\\n', 'That night there ran a legend through Vitry-sur-Marne of a mad Englishman,\\n', 'doubtless suffering from sunstroke, who had drunk all the officers of the\\n', 'garrison under the table, had borrowed a horse from the lines, and had then and\\n', 'there eloped, after the English custom, with one of those more mad English\\n', 'girls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good Monsieur Kami.\\n', '\\n', '\"They are very droll,\" said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight by the\\n', 'studio wall. \"She walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing, and yet\\n', 'she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister, and gives me--see--\\n', 'ten francs!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts; for he prided himself on\\n', 'being a good soldier.\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais; but he was\\n', 'careful to attend to all her wants, to get her a compartment entirely to\\n', 'herself, and to leave her alone.

By Dick\\'s showing,--\\n', 'when he was off his head,--she must have ordered him about very thoroughly.\\n', 'Wonder how she likes being under orders.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie never told. She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes shut,\\n', 'that she might realise the sensation of blindness. It was an order that she\\n', 'should return to London swiftly, and she found herself at last almost beginning\\n', 'to enjoy the situation. This was better than looking after luggage and a red-\\n', 'haired friend who never took any interest in her surroundings. But there\\n', 'appeared to be a feeling in the air that she, Maisie,--of all people,--was in\\n', 'disgrace. Therefore she justified her conduct to herself with great success,\\n', 'till Torpenhow came up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell\\n', 'the story of Dick\"s blindness, suppressing a few details, but dwelling at\\n', 'length on the miseries of delirium. He stopped before he reached the end, as\\n', 'though he had lost interest in the subject, and went forward to smoke. Maisie\\n', 'was furious with him and with herself.\\n', '\\n', 'She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for\\n', 'breakfast, and--she was past any feeling of indignation now--was bidden curtly\\n', 'to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead-covered stairs while Torpenhow went\\n', 'up to make inquiries. Again the knowledge that she was being treated like a\\n', \"naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame. It was all Dick's fault for\\n\", 'being so stupid as to go blind.\\n', '\\n', 'Torpenhow led her up to a shut door, which he opened very softly. Dick was\\n', 'sitting by the window, with his chin on his chest. There were three envelopes\\n', 'in his hand, and he turned them over and over. The big man who gave orders was\\n', 'no longer by her side, and the studio door snapped behind her.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound. \"Hullo, Torp! Is\\n', 'that you? I\\'ve been so lonely.\"\\n', '\\n', 'His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed herself\\n', 'up into a corner of the room. Her heart was beating furiously, and she put one\\n', 'hand on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring directly at her, and she\\n', 'realised for the first time that he was blind.\\n', '\\n', 'Shutting her eyes in a rail-way carriage to open them when she pleased was\\n', \"child's play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Torp, is that you? They said you were coming.\" Dick looked puzzled and a\\n', 'little irritated at the silence.\\n', '\\n', '\"No; it\\'s only me,\" was the answer, in a strained little whisper. Maisie could\\n', 'hardly move her lips.\\n', '\\n', '\"H\\'m!\" said Dick, composedly, without moving. \"This is a new phenomenon.\\n', 'Darkness I\\'m getting used to; but I object to hearing voices.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself? Maisie\"s heart\\n', 'beat more wildly, and she breathed in gasps. Dick rose and began to feel his\\n', 'way across the room, touching each table and chair as he passed. Once he caught\\n', 'his foot on a rug, and swore, dropping on his knees to feel what the\\n', 'obstruction might be. Maisie remembered him walking in the Park as though all\\n', 'the earth belonged to him, tramping up and down her studio two months ago, and\\n', 'flying up the gangway of the Channel steamer. The beating of her heart was\\n', 'making her sick, and Dick was coming nearer, guided by the sound of her\\n', 'breathing. She put out a hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to\\n', 'herself, she did not know which. It touched his chest, and he stepped back as\\n', 'though he had been shot.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s Maisie!\" said he, with a dry sob. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I came--I came--to see you, please.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Dick's lips closed firmly.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Won\\'t you sit down, then?

Let me alone!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He groped back to his chair, his chest labouring as he sat down.\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie watched him, and the fear went out of her heart, to be followed by a\\n', 'very bitter shame. He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl\\n', 'through every step of the impetuous flight to London; for he was, indeed, down\\n', 'and done for--masterful no longer but rather a little abject; neither an artist\\n', 'stronger than she, nor a man to be looked up to--only some blind one that sat\\n', 'in a chair and seemed on the point of crying. She was immensely and unfeignedly\\n', 'sorry for him--more sorry than she had ever been for any one in her life, but\\n', 'not sorry enough to deny his words.\\n', '\\n', 'So she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt, because she had honestly\\n', 'intended that her journey should end triumphantly; and now she was only filled\\n', 'with pity most startlingly distinct from love.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well?\" said Dick, his face steadily turned away. \"I never meant to worry you\\n', 'any more. What\\'s the matter?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as unprepared as\\n', 'herself for the torrent of emotion that followed. She had dropped into a chair\\n', 'and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.\\n', '\\n', '\"I  can\\'t--I  can\\'t!\" she cried desperately. \"Indeed, I can\\'t. It isn\\'t my\\n', 'fault. I\\'m so sorry. Oh, Dickie, I\\'m so sorry.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Dick's shoulders straightened again, for the words lashed like a whip.\\n\", '\\n', 'Still the sobbing continued. It is not good to realise that you have failed in\\n', 'the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of making sacrifices.\\n', '\\n', '\"I do despise myself--indeed I do. But I can\\'t. Oh, Dickie, you wouldn\\'t ask\\n', 'me--would you?\" wailed Maisie.\\n', '\\n', \"She looked up for a minute, and by chance it happened that Dick's eyes fell on\\n\", 'hers. The unshaven face was very white and set, and the lips were trying to\\n', 'force themselves into a smile. But it was the worn-out eyes that Maisie feared.\\n', 'Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place some one that she could hardly\\n', 'recognise till he spoke.\\n', '\\n', '\"Who is asking you to do anything, Maisie? I told you how it would be. What\\'s\\n', 'the use of worrying? For pity\\'s sake don\\'t cry like that; it isn\\'t worth it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You don\\'t know how I hate myself. Oh, Dick, help me--help me!\" The passion of\\n', 'tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm the man. He\\n', 'stumbled forward and put his arm round her, and her head fell on his shoulder.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hush, dear, hush! Don\\'t cry. You\\'re quite right, and you\\'ve nothing to\\n', \"reproach yourself with--you never had. You're only a little upset by the\\n\", \"journey, and I don't suppose you've had any breakfast. What a brute Torp was to\\n\", 'bring you over.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wanted to come. I did indeed,\" she protested.\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well. And now you\\'ve come and seen, and I\\'m--immensely grateful. When\\n', \"you're better you shall go away and get something to eat. What sort of a\\n\", 'passage did you have coming over?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Maisie was crying more subduedly, for the first time in her life glad that she\\n', 'had something to lean against. Dick patted her on the shoulder tenderly but\\n', 'clumsily, for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be.\\n', '\\n', 'She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited, trembling and most\\n', 'unhappy. He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room between\\n', 'them, and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart.\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you better now?\" he said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, but--don\\'t you hate me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I hate you? My God! I?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Isn\\'t--isn\\'t there anything I could do for you, then? I\\'ll stay here in\\n', 'England to do it, if you like. Perhaps I could come and see you sometimes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think not, dear. It would be kindest not to see me any more, please. I don\\'t\\n', 'want to seem rude, but--don\\'t you think--perhaps you had almost better go now.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain\\n', 'continued much longer.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t deserve anything else. I\\'ll go, Dick. Oh, I\\'m so miserable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nonsense. You\\'ve nothing to worry about; I\\'d tell you if you had. Wait a\\n', \"moment, dear. I've got something to give you first. I meant it for you ever\\n\", \"since this little trouble began. It's my Melancolia; she was a beauty when I\\n\", \"last saw her. You can keep her for me, and if ever you're poor you can sell\\n\", 'her. She\\'s worth a few hundreds at any state of the market.\" He groped among\\n', 'his canvases. \"She\\'s framed in black. Is this a black frame that I have my hand\\n', 'on? There she is. What do you think of her?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, and the eyes\\n', 'strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One thing and one\\n', 'thing only could she do for him.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The voice was fuller and more rounded, because the man knew he was speaking of\\n', 'his best work. Maisie looked at the blur, and a lunatic desire to laugh caught\\n', \"her by the throat. But for Dick's sake--whatever this mad blankness might mean-\\n\", '-she must make no sign. Her voice choked with hard-held tears as she answered,\\n', 'still gazing at the wreck--\"Oh, Dick, it is good!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute. \"Won\\'t you have\\n', 'it, then? I\\'ll send it over to your house if you will.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I? Oh yes--thank you. Ha! ha!\" If she did not fly at once the laughter that\\n', 'was worse than tears would kill her. She turned and ran, choking and blinded,\\n', 'down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge in a cab and go to\\n', 'her house across the Parks. There she sat down in the dismantled drawing-room\\n', 'and thought of Dick in his blindness, useless till the end of life, and of\\n', 'herself in her own eyes. Behind the sorrow, the shame, and the humiliation, lay\\n', 'fear of the cold wrath of the red-haired girl when Maisie should return. Maisie\\n', 'had never feared her companion before. Not until she found herself saying,\\n', '\"Well, he never asked me,\" did she realise her scorn of herself.\\n', 'And that is the end of Maisie.\\n', '* * * * * *\\n', '\\n', 'For Dick was reserved more searching torment. He could not realise at first\\n', 'that Maisie, whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell.\\n', 'He was savagely angry against Torpenhow, who had brought upon him this\\n', 'humiliation and troubled his miserable peace. Then his dark hour came and he\\n', 'was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the\\n', 'darkness. The queen could do no wrong, but in following the right, so far as it\\n', 'served her work, she had wounded her one subject more than his own brain would\\n', 'let him know.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s all I had and I\\'ve lost it,\" he said, as soon as the misery permitted\\n', 'clear thinking. \"And Torp will think that he has been so infernally clever that\\n', 'I shan\\'t have the heart to tell him. I must think this out quietly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hullo!\" said Torpenhow, entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two hours\\n', 'of thought. \"I\\'m back. Are you feeling any better?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Torp, I don\\'t know what to say. Come here.\" Dick coughed huskily, wondering,\\n', 'indeed, what he should say, and how to say it temperately.\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the need for saying anything? Get up and tramp.\" Torpenhow was\\n', 'perfectly satisfied.\\n', '\\n', \"They walked up and down as of custom, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's shoulder, and\\n\", 'Dick buried in his own thoughts.\\n', '\\n', '\"How in the world did you find it all out?\" said Dick, at last.\\n', '\\n', '\"You shouldn\\'t go off your head if you want to keep secrets, Dickie. It was\\n', \"absolutely impertinent on my part; but if you'd seen me rocketing about on a\\n\", \"half-trained French troop-horse under a blazing sun you'd have laughed. There\\n\", 'will be a charivari in my rooms tonight. Seven other devils----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know--the row in the Southern Soudan. I surprised their councils the other\\n', \"day, and it made me unhappy. Have you fixed your flint to go? Who d'you work\\n\", 'for?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Haven\\'t signed any contracts yet. I wanted to see how your business would turn\\n', 'out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Would you have stayed with me, then, if--things had gone wrong?\" He put his\\n', 'question cautiously.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t ask me too much.

I\\'ll stay quiet\\n', 'here.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And meditate? I don\\'t blame you. You observe a good time if ever a man did.\"\\n', '\\n', 'That night there was a tumult on the stairs. The correspondents poured in from\\n', \"theatre, dinner, and music-hall to Torpenhow's room that they might discuss\\n\", 'their plan of campaign in the event of military operations becoming a\\n', 'certainty. Torpenhow, the Keneu,, and the Nilghai had bidden all the men they\\n', 'had worked with to the orgy; and Mr. Beeton, the housekeeper, declared that\\n', 'never before in his checkered experience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of\\n', 'gentlemen. They waked the chambers with shoutings and song; and the elder men\\n', 'were quite as bad as the younger. For the chances of war were in front of them,\\n', 'and all knew what those meant.\\n', '\\n', 'Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the landing,\\n', 'Dick suddenly began to laugh to himself.\\n', '\\n', '\"When one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic.

Torpenhow had been long away;\\n', 'there was no more rioting in the chambers, and Dick had settled down to his new\\n', 'life, which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than death.\\n', '\\n', 'It is hard to live alone in the dark, confusing the day and night; dropping to\\n', 'sleep through sheer weariness at mid-day, and rising restless in the chill of\\n', 'the dawn. At first Dick, on his awakenings, would grope along the corridors of\\n', 'the chambers till he heard some one snore. Then he would know that the day had\\n', 'not yet come, and return wearily to his bedroom.\\n', '\\n', 'Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the house\\n', 'and Mr. Beeton advised him to get up. Once dressed--and dressing, now that\\n', 'Torpenhow was away, was a lengthy business, because collars, ties, and the like\\n', 'hid themselves in far corners of the room, and search meant head-beating\\n', 'against chairs and trunks--once dressed, there was nothing whatever to do\\n', 'except to sit still and brood till the three daily meals came. Centuries\\n', 'separated breakfast from lunch and lunch from dinner, and though a man prayed\\n', 'for hundreds of years that his mind might be taken from him, God would never\\n', 'hear. Rather the mind was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against\\n', 'each other as millstones grind when there is no corn between; and yet the brain\\n', 'would not wear out and give him rest. It continued to think, at length, with\\n', 'imagery and all manner of reminiscences. It recalled Maisie and past success,\\n', 'reckless travels by land and sea, the glory of doing work and feeling that it\\n', 'was good, and suggested all that might have happened had the eyes only been\\n', 'faithful to their duty. When thinking ceased through sheer weariness, there\\n', \"poured into Dick's soul tide on tide of overwhelming, purposeless fear--dread\\n\", 'of starvation always, terror lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon\\n', \"him, fear of fire in the chambers and a louse's death in red flame, and agonies\\n\", 'of fiercer horror that had nothing to do with any fear of death. Then Dick\\n', 'bowed his head, and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating\\n', 'self till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set\\n', 'before him.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare, and Dick learned to\\n', 'hang upon his speech, which dealt with badly fitted gas-plugs, waste-pipes out\\n', 'of repair, little tricks for driving picture-nails into walls, and the sins of\\n', 'the charwoman or the housemaids. In the lack of better things the small gossip\\n', \"of a servants' hall becomes immensely interesting, and the screwing of a washer\\n\", 'on a tap an event to be talked over for days.\\n', '\\n', 'Once or twice a week, too, Mr. Beeton would take Dick out with him when he went\\n', 'marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish, lamp-wicks,\\n', 'mustard, tapioca, and so forth, while Dick rested his weight first on one foot\\n', 'and then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins and string-ball on the\\n', \"counter. Then they would perhaps meet one of Mr. Beeton's friends, and Dick,\\n\", 'standing aside a little, would hold his peace till Mr. Beeton was willing to go\\n', 'on again.\\n', '\\n', 'The life did not increase his self-respect. He abandoned shaving as a dangerous\\n', \"exercise, and being shaved in a barber's shop meant exposure of his infirmity.\\n\", 'He could not see that his clothes were properly brushed, and since he had never\\n', 'taken any care of his personal appearance he became every known variety of\\n', 'sloven. A blind man cannot deal with cleanliness till he has been some months\\n', 'used to the darkness. If he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it,\\n', 'he must assert himself and stand upright. Then the meanest menial can see that\\n', 'he is blind and, therefore, of no consequence. A wise man will keep his eyes on\\n', 'the floor and sit still. For amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the\\n', 'scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender, keeping\\n', 'count of the lumps, which must all be put back again, one by one and very\\n', 'carefully. He may set himself sums if he cares to work them out; he may talk to\\n', 'himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him; and if his trade has been\\n', 'that of an artist, he may sketch in the air with his forefinger; but that is\\n', 'too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut. He may go to his bookshelves\\n', 'and count his books, ranging them in order of their size; or to his wardrobe\\n', 'and count his shirts, laying them in piles of two or three on the bed, as they\\n', 'suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons.\\n', '\\n', 'Even this entertainment wearies after a time; and all the times are very, very\\n', 'long.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was allowed to sort a tool-chest where Mr. Beeton kept hammers, taps and\\n', 'nuts, lengths of gas-pipes, oil-bottles, and string.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I don\\'t have everything just where I know where to look for it, why, then,\\n', \"I can't find anything when I do want it.

This particular nerve through long\\n', 'battering had ceased to feel--much.\\n', '\\n', '\"I was thinking,\" continued Mr. Beeton, still making as if to go, \"that you\\n', 'might like to hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an evening.

I wish I could go to Torp\\n', 'and the Nilghai, even though I were in their way.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Pussy left the room before the speech was ended, and Alf, as he entered, found\\n', 'Dick addressing the empty hearth-rug.\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s a letter for you, sir,\" he said. \"Perhaps you\\'d like me to read it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lend it to me for a minute and I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not over-steady. It\\n', 'was within the limits of human possibility that--that was no letter from\\n', 'Maisie. He knew the heft of three closed envelopes only too well. It was a\\n', 'foolish hope that the girl should write to him, for he did not realise that\\n', 'there is a wrong which admits of no reparation though the evildoer may with\\n', \"tears and the heart's best love strive to mend all. It is best to forget that\\n\", 'wrong whether it be caused or endured, since it is as remediless as bad work\\n', 'once put forward.\\n', '\\n', '\"Read it, then,\" said Dick, and Alf began intoning according to the rules of\\n', 'the Board School--\"\\'I could have given you love, I could have given you\\n', 'loyalty, such as you never dreamed of. Do you suppose I cared what you were?\\n', 'But you chose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing. My only excuse\\n', 'for you is that you are so young.\\' \"That\\'s all,\" he said, returning the paper\\n', 'to be dropped into the fire.\\n', '\\n', '\"What was in the letter?\" asked Mrs. Beeton, when Alf returned.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know. I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin\\' at\\n', 'everything when you\\'re young.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and it has\\n', 'bounced up and hit me. God help it, whatever it is--unless it was all a joke.\\n', 'But I don\\'t know any one who\"d take the trouble to play a joke on me--Love and\\n', 'loyalty for nothing. It sounds tempting enough. I wonder whether I have lost\\n', 'anything really?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had put\\n', \"himself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman's hands.\\n\", '\\n', 'Still, the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think about\\n', 'stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night. When his heart\\n', 'was so full of despair that it would hold no more, body and soul together\\n', 'seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness.\\n', '\\n', 'Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light again. But\\n', 'there was no light to be reached. When that agony had left him sweating and\\n', 'breathless, the downward flight would recommence till the gathering torture of\\n', 'it spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the first. Followed some few\\n', 'minutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw. Then the procession of events\\n', 'would repeat itself till he was utterly worn out and the brain took up its\\n', 'everlasting consideration of Maisie and might-have-beens.\\n', '\\n', 'At the end of everything Mr. Beeton came to his room and volunteered to take\\n', 'him out. \"Not marketing this time, but we\\'ll go into the Parks if you like.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Be damned if I do,\" quoth Dick. \"Keep to the streets and walk up and down. I\\n', 'like to hear the people round me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was not altogether true. The blind in the first stages of their infirmity\\n', 'dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted arms--but Dick had\\n', 'no earthly desire to go to the Parks. Once and only once since Maisie had shut\\n', \"her door he had gone there under Alf's charge. Alf forgot him and fished for\\n\", \"minnows in the Serpentine with some companions. After half an hour's waiting\\n\", 'Dick, almost weeping with rage and wrath, caught a passer-by, who introduced\\n', 'him to a friendly policeman, who led him to a four-wheeler opposite the Albert\\n', \"Hall. He never told Mr. Beeton of Alf's forgetfulness, but . . . this was not\\n\", 'the manner in which he was used to walk the Parks aforetime.\\n', '\\n', '\"What streets would you like to walk down, then?\" said Mr. Beeton,\\n', 'sympathetically. His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on the\\n', 'grass of Green Park with his family, and half a dozen paper bags full of food.\\n', '\\n', '\"Keep to the river,\" said Dick, and they kept to the river, and the rush of it\\n', 'was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck thence on to\\n', 'the Waterloo Road, Mr. Beeton explaining the beauties of the scenery as he went\\n', 'on.\\n', '\\n', '\"And walking on the other side of the pavement,\" said he, \"unless I\\'m much\\n', 'mistaken, is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be drawed. I\\n', \"never forgets a face and I never remembers a name, except paying tenants, 'o\\n\", 'course!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Stop her,\" said Dick. \"It\\'s Bessie Broke. Tell her I\\'d like to speak to her\\n', 'again. Quick, man!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested\\n', 'Bessie then on her way northward. She recognised him as the man in authority\\n', 'who used to glare at her when she passed up Dick\"s staircase, and her first\\n', 'impulse was to run.\\n', '\\n', '\"Wasn\\'t you Mr. Heldar\\'s model?\" said Mr. Beeton, planting himself in front of\\n', 'her. \"You was. He\\'s on the other side of the road and he\\'d like to see you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why?\" said Bessie, faintly. She remembered--indeed had never for long\\n', 'forgotten--an affair connected with a newly finished picture.\\n', '\\n', '\"Because he has asked me to do so, and because he\\'s most particular blind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Drunk?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No. \\'Orspital blind. He can\\'t see. That\\'s him over there.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr. Beeton pointed him\\n', 'out--a stub-bearded, bowed creature wearing a dirty magenta-coloured neckcloth\\n', 'outside an unbrushed coat. There was nothing to fear from such an one. Even if\\n', 'he chased her, Bessie thought, he could not follow far. She crossed over, and\\n', \"Dick's face lighted up. It was long since a woman of any kind had taken the\\n\", 'trouble to speak to him.\\n', '\\n', '\"I hope you\\'re well, Mr. Heldar?\" said Bessie, a little puzzled. Mr. Beeton\\n', 'stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m very well indeed, and, by Jove! I\\'m glad to see--hear you, I mean, Bess.\\n', 'You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after you got your\\n', \"money. I don't know why you should. Are you going anywhere in particular just\\n\", 'now?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I was going for a walk,\" said Bessie.\\n', '\\n', '\"Not the old business?\" Dick spoke under his breath.\\n', '\\n', '\"Lor, no! I paid my premium\"--Bessie was very proud of that word--\"for a\\n', 'barmaid, sleeping in, and I\\'m at the bar now quite respectable. Indeed I am.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human nature.\\n', 'Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his gas-plugs\\n', 'without a word of apology. Bessie watched the flight with a certain uneasiness;\\n', 'but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the harm that had been done to\\n', 'him . . .\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s hard work pulling the beer-handles,\" she went on, \"and they\\'ve got one of\\n', 'them penny-in-the-slot cash-machines, so if you get wrong by a penny at the end\\n', 'of the day--but then I don\\'t believe the machinery is right. Do you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve only seen it work. Mr. Beeton.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'s gone.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m afraid I must ask you to help me home, then. I\\'ll make it worth your\\n', 'while. You see.\" The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie saw.\\n', '\\n', '\"It isn\\'t taking you out of your way?\" he said hesitatingly. \"I can ask a\\n', 'policeman if it is.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not at all. I come on at seven and I\\'m off at four. That\\'s easy hours.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good God!--but I\\'m on all the time. I wish I had some work to do too. Let\\'s go\\n', 'home, Bess.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk, recoiling with an oath.\\n', 'Bessie took his arm and said nothing--as she had said nothing when he had\\n', 'ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light. They walked for some\\n', 'time in silence, the girl steering him deftly through the crowd.\\n', '\\n', '\"And where\\'s--where\\'s Mr. Torpenhow?\" she inquired at last.\\n', '\\n', '\"He has gone away to the desert.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Where\\'s that?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick pointed to the right. \"East--out of the mouth of the river,\" said he.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then west, then south, and then east again, all along the under-side of\\n', 'Europe. Then south again, God knows how far.\" The explanation did not enlighten\\n', 'Bessie in the least, but she held her tongue and looked to Dick\"s patch till\\n', 'they came to the chambers.\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'ll have tea and muffins,\" he said joyously. \"I can\\'t tell you, Bessie, how\\n', 'glad I am to find you again. What made you go away so suddenly?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I didn\\'t think you\\'d want me any more,\" she said, emboldened by his ignorance.\\n', '\\n', '\"I didn\\'t, as a matter of fact--but afterwards--At any rate I\\'m glad you\\'ve\\n', 'come. You know the stairs.\"\\n', '\\n', 'So Bessie led him home to his own place--there was no one to hinder--and shut\\n', 'the door of the studio.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a mess!\" was her first word. \"All these things haven\\'t been looked after\\n', 'for months and months.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, only weeks, Bess. You can\\'t expect them to care.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know what you expect them to do. They ought to know what you\\'ve paid\\n', 'them for. The dust\\'s just awful. It\\'s all over the easel.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t use it much now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All over the pictures and the floor, and all over your coat. I\\'d like to speak\\n', 'to them housemaids.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Ring for tea, then.\" Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by custom.\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie saw the action and, as far as in her lay, was touched. But there\\n', 'remained always a keen sense of new-found superiority, and it was in her voice\\n', 'when she spoke.\\n', '\\n', '\"How long have you been like this?\" she said wrathfully, as though the\\n', 'blindness were some fault of the housemaids.\\n', '\\n', '\"How?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"As you are.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The day after you went away with the check, almost as soon as my picture was\\n', 'finished; I hardly saw her alive.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then they\\'ve been cheating you ever since, that\\'s all. I know their nice\\n', 'little ways.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A woman may love one man and despise another, but on general feminine\\n', 'principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being\\n', 'defrauded. Her loved one can look to himself, but the other man, being\\n', 'obviously an idiot, needs protection.\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t think Mr. Beeton cheats much,\" said Dick. Bessie was flouncing up and\\n', 'down the room, and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment as he heard\\n', 'the swish of her skirts and the light step between.\\n', '\\n', '\"Tea and muffins,\" she said shortly, when the ring at the bell was answered;\\n', '\"two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot. I don\\'t want the old teapot that\\n', 'was here when I used to come. It don\\'t draw. Get another.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The housemaid went away scandalised, and Dick chuckled. Then he began to cough\\n', 'as Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust.\\n', '\\n', '\"What are you trying to do?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Put things straight. This is like unfurnished lodgings. How could you let it\\n', 'go so?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How could I help it? Dust away.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She dusted furiously, and in the midst of all the pother entered Mrs. Beeton.\\n', 'Her husband on his return had explained the situation, winding up with the\\n', 'peculiarly felicitous proverb, \"Do unto others as you would be done by.\" She\\n', 'had descended to put into her place the person who demanded muffins and an\\n', 'uncracked teapot as though she had a right to both.\\n', '\\n', '\"Muffins ready yet?\" said Bess, still dusting. She was no longer a drab of the\\n', \"streets but a young lady who, thanks to Dick's check, had paid her premium and\\n\", 'was entitled to pull beer-handles with the best. Being neatly dressed in black\\n', 'she did not hesitate to face Mrs. Beeton, and there passed between the two\\n', 'women certain regards that Dick would have appreciated. The situation adjusted\\n', 'itself by eye. Bessie had won, and Mrs. Beeton returned to cook muffins and\\n', 'make scathing remarks about models, hussies, trollops, and the like, to her\\n', 'husband.\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s nothing to be got of interfering with him, Liza,\" he said. \"Alf, you\\n', \"go along into the street to play. When he isn't crossed he's as kindly as kind,\\n\", \"but when he's crossed he's the devil and all. We took too many little things\\n\", 'out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular about what he does.\\n', \"They ain't no objects to a blind man, of course, but if it was to come into\\n\", \"court we'd get the sack. Yes, I did introduce him to that girl because I'm a\\n\", 'feelin\\' man myself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Much too feelin\\'!\" Mrs. Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish, and thought\\n', 'of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion.\\n', '\\n', '\"I ain\\'t ashamed of it, and it isn\\'t for us to judge him hard so long as he\\n', 'pays quiet and regular as he do. I know how to manage young gentlemen, you know\\n', 'how to cook for them, and what I says is, let each stick to his own business\\n', \"and then there won't be any trouble. Take them muffins down, Liza, and be sure\\n\", \"you have no words with that young woman. His lot is cruel hard, and if he's\\n\", 'crossed he do swear worse than any one I\"ve ever served.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s a little better,\" said Bessie, sitting down to the tea. \"You needn\\'t\\n', 'wait, thank you, Mrs. Beeton.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I had no intention of doing such, I do assure you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie made no answer whatever. This, she knew, was the way in which real\\n', 'ladies routed their foes, and when one is a barmaid at a first-class public-\\n', \"house one may become a real lady at ten minutes' notice.\\n\", '\\n', 'Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and displeased.\\n', 'There were droppings of food all down the front of his coat; the mouth under\\n', 'the ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the forehead was lined and\\n', 'contracted; and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour\\n', 'that might or might not have been called gray. The utter misery and self-\\n', 'abandonment of the man appealed to her, and at the bottom of her heart lay the\\n', 'wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! it is good to hear you moving about,\" said Dick, rubbing his hands. \"Tell\\n', 'us all about your bar successes, Bessie, and the way you live now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Never mind that. I\\'m quite respectable, as you\\'d see by looking at me. You\\n', \"don't seem to live too well. What made you go blind that sudden? Why isn't\\n\", 'there any one to look after you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of it.\\n', '\\n', '\"I was cut across the head a long time ago, and that ruined my eyes.

Take it off, it don\"t become you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good gracious, child, do you imagine that I think of what becomes of me these\\n', 'days?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You ought. Get that taken off before I come here again. I suppose I can come,\\n', 'can\\'t I?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'d be only too grateful if you did.

Come and see me when you can and as often as you can.\\n', \"God knows, there isn't a soul in the world to take that trouble except you and\\n\", 'Mr. Beeton.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A lot of trouble he\\'s taking and she too.\" This with a toss of the head.\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ve let you do anyhow and they haven\\'t done anything for you.

For weeks he had forced himself not to think of the Melancolia, because\\n', \"she was a part of his dead life. With Bessie's return and certain new prospects\\n\", 'that had developed themselves, the Melancolia--lovelier in his imagination than\\n', 'she had ever been on canvas--reappeared. By her aid he might have procured more\\n', 'money wherewith to amuse Bess and to forget Maisie, as well as another taste of\\n', \"an almost forgotten success. Now, thanks to a vicious little housemaid's folly,\\n\", 'there was nothing to look for--not even the hope that he might some day take an\\n', 'abiding interest in the housemaid. Worst of all, he had been made to appear\\n', \"ridiculous in Maisie's eyes. A woman will forgive the man who has ruined her\\n\", \"life's work so long as he gives her love; a man may forgive those who ruin the\\n\", 'love of his life, but he will never forgive the destruction of his work.\\n', '\\n', '\"Tck--tck--tck,\" said Dick between his teeth, and then laughed softly. \"It\\'s an\\n', 'omen, Bessie, and--a good many things considered, it serves me right for doing\\n', \"what I have done. By Jove! that accounts for Maisie's running away. She must\\n\", 'have thought me perfectly mad--small blame to her! The whole picture ruined,\\n', 'isn\\'t it so? What made you do it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Because I was that angry. I\\'m not angry now--I\\'m awful sorry.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wonder.--It doesn\\'t matter, anyhow. I\\'m to blame for making the mistake.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What mistake?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Something you wouldn\\'t understand, dear. Great heavens! to think that a little\\n', 'piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride!\" Dick was talking to\\n', 'himself as Bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist.\\n', '\\n', '\"I ain\\'t a piece of dirt, and you shouldn\\'t call me so! I did it \\'cause I hated\\n', 'you, and I\\'m only sorry now \\'cause you\\'re \\'cause you\\'re----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Exactly--because I\\'m blind. There\\'s noting like tact in little things.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie began to sob. She did not like being shackled against her will; she was\\n', 'afraid of the blind face and the look upon it, and was sorry too that her great\\n', 'revenge had only made Dick laugh.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t cry,\" he said, and took her into his arms. \"You only did what you\\n', 'thought right.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I--I ain\\'t a little piece of dirt, and if you say that I\\'ll never come to you\\n', 'again.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You don\\'t know what you\\'ve done to me. I\\'m not angry--indeed, I\\'m not. Be\\n', 'quiet for a minute.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Bessie remained in his arms shrinking.

When that resource goes\\n', 'the man is to be pitied and left alone.\\n', '\\n', 'These things and some others Dick considered while he was holding Bessie to his\\n', 'heart.\\n', '\\n', '\"Though you mayn\\'t know it,\" he said, raising his head, \"the Lord is a just and\\n', 'a terrible God, Bess; with a very strong sense of humour. It serves me right--\\n', 'how it serves me right! Torp could understand it if he were here; he must have\\n', 'suffered something at your hands, child, but only for a minute or so. I saved\\n', 'him. Set that to my credit, some one.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me go,\" said Bess, her face darkening. \"Let me go.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All in good time.

We will get away--that is to say, I will.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then you won\\'t----?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m afraid not, dear.

Get it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bessie cursed under her breath. She had pitied the man sincerely, had kissed\\n', 'him with almost equal sincerity, for he was not unhandsome; it pleased her to\\n', 'be in a way and for a time his protector, and above all there were four\\n', 'thousand pounds to be handled by some one. Now through a slip of the tongue and\\n', 'a little feminine desire to give a little, not too much, pain she had lost the\\n', 'money, the blessed idleness and the pretty things, the companionship, and the\\n', 'chance of looking outwardly as respectable as a real lady.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now fill me a pipe.

Wait a minute; get me a pen\\n', 'and a sheet of notepaper.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see, and Dick had particular\\n', 'reasons for wishing that his work should be clear.

Then he kissed her, and laid himself down in his bunk until\\n', 'the decks should be clear. He who had taken so long to move about his own\\n', 'darkened rooms well understood the geography of a ship, and the necessity of\\n', 'seeing to his own comforts was as wine to him.\\n', '\\n', 'Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been\\n', 'introduced to the head-steward, had royally tipped him, secured a good place at\\n', 'table, opened out his baggage, and settled himself down with joy in the cabin.\\n', 'It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about, for he knew\\n', 'everything so well. Then God was very kind: a deep sleep of weariness came upon\\n', 'him just as he would have thought of Maisie, and he slept till the steamer had\\n', 'cleared the mouth of the Thames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel.\\n', '\\n', 'The rattle of the engines, the reek of oil and paint, and a very familiar sound\\n', 'in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, it\\'s good to be alive again!\" He yawned, stretched himself vigorously, and\\n', 'went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of the lights of\\n', 'Brighton. This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square is a common; the\\n', 'free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less Dick could feel the healing of\\n', 'the sea at work upon him already. A boisterous little cross-swell swung the\\n', 'steamer disrespectfully by the nose; and one wave breaking far aft spattered\\n', 'the quarterdeck and the pile of new deck-chairs. He heard the foam fall with\\n', 'the clash of broken glass, was stung in the face by a cupful, and sniffing\\n', 'luxuriously, felt his way to the smoking-room by the wheel. There a strong\\n', 'breeze found him, blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway, and\\n', 'the smoking-room steward, understanding that he was a voyager of experience,\\n', 'said that the weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than\\n', 'half a gale in the Bay. These things fell as they were foretold, and Dick\\n', 'enjoyed himself to the utmost. It is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay\\n', 'firm hold upon tables, stanchions, and ropes in moving from place to place. On\\n', 'land the man who feels with his hands is patently blind. At sea even a blind\\n', 'man who is not sea-sick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of his\\n', 'fellows. Dick told the doctor many tales--and these are coin of more value than\\n', 'silver if properly handled--smoked with him till unholy hours of the night, and\\n', 'so won his short-lived regard that he promised Dick a few hours of his time\\n', 'when they came to Port Said.\\n', '\\n', 'And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew, and the engines sang their\\n', 'song day and night, and the sun grew stronger day by day, and Tom the Lascar\\n', 'barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened hatch-grating where the cool\\n', 'winds blew, and the awnings were spread and the passengers made merry, and at\\n', 'last they came to Port Said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Take me,\" said Dick, to the doctor, \"to Madame Binat\\'s--if you know where that\\n', 'is.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Whew!\" said the doctor, \"I do.

Then he comes back to me, for his well-\\n', 'beloved is here, and if I do not receive a telegram from Suakin saying that\\n', 'thou art well, the girl answers for George.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Thank you.\" He reached out sleepily for the cup. \"You are much too kind,\\n', 'Madame.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If there were anything that I might do I would say, stay here and be wise; but\\n', 'I do not think that would be best for thee.\" She looked at her liquor-stained\\n', 'dress with a sad smile. \"Nay, thou shalt go, in truth, thou shalt go. It is\\n', 'best so. My boy, it is best so.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes. \"That is for good-morning,\" she\\n', 'said, going away. \"When thou art dressed we will speak to George and make\\n', 'everything ready. But first we must open the little trunk. Give me the keys.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous. I shall expect Torp\\n', 'to kiss me next. He is more likely to swear at me for getting in his way,\\n', \"though. Well, it won't last long.--Ohe, Madame, help me to my toilette of the\\n\", 'guillotine! There will be no chance of dressing properly out yonder.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He was rummaging among his new campaign-kit, and rowelling his hands with the\\n', 'spurs. There are two ways of wearing well-oiled ankle-jacks, spotless blue\\n', 'bands, khaki coat and breeches, and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet. The right\\n', 'way is the way of the untired man, master of himself, setting out upon an\\n', 'expedition, well pleased.\\n', '\\n', '\"Everything must be very correct,\" Dick explained. \"It will become dirty\\n', 'afterwards, but now it is good to feel well dressed. Is everything as it should\\n', 'be?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on the\\n', 'right hip and fingered his collar.\\n', '\\n', '\"I can do no more,\" Madame said, between laughing and crying. \"Look at thyself-\\n', '-but I forgot.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am very content.\" He stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now let us go and see the captain and George and the lighthouse boat. Be\\n', 'quick, Madame.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the daylight.\\n', 'Figure to yourself if some English ladies----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There are no English ladies; and if there are, I have forgotten them. Take me\\n', 'there.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse\\n', 'boat began to move. Madame had said a great deal both to George and the captain\\n', \"touching the arrangements that were to be made for Dick's benefit. Very few men\\n\", \"who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard Madame's advice. That\\n\", 'sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell\\n', 'upon surprisingly short provocation.\\n', '\\n', 'For six days--two of them were wasted in the crowded Canal--the little steamer\\n', 'worked her way to Suakin, where she was to pick up the superintendent of the\\n', 'lighthouse; and Dick made it his business to propitiate George, who was\\n', 'distracted with fears for the safety of his light-of-love and half inclined to\\n', 'make Dick responsible for his own discomfort. When they arrived George took him\\n', 'under his wing, and together they entered the red-hot seaport, encumbered with\\n', 'the material and wastage of the Suakin-Berger line, from locomotives in\\n', 'disconsolate fragments to mounds of chairs and pot-sleepers.\\n', '\\n', '\"If you keep with me,\" said George, \"nobody will ask for passports or what you\\n', 'do. They are all very busy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; but I should like to hear some of the Englishmen talk. They might\\n', 'remember me. I was known here a long time ago--when I was some one indeed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A long time ago is a very long time ago here. The graveyards are full. Now\\n', 'listen. This new railway runs out so far as Tanai-el-Hassan--that is seven\\n', 'miles. Then there is a camp. They say that beyond Tanai-el-Hassan the English\\n', 'troops go forward, and everything that they require will be brought to them by\\n', 'this line.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Ah! Base camp. I see. That\\'s a better business than fighting Fuzzies in the\\n', 'open.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"For this reason even the mules go up in the iron-train.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Iron what?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is all covered with iron, because it is still being shot at.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"An armoured train. Better and better! Go on, faithful George.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And I go up with my mules tonight. Only those who particularly require to go\\n', 'to the camp go out with the train. They begin to shoot not far from the city.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The dears--they always used to!\" Dick snuffed the smell of parched dust,\\n', 'heated iron, and flaking paint with delight. Certainly the old life was\\n', 'welcoming him back most generously.\\n', '\\n', '\"When I have got my mules together I go up tonight, but you must first send a\\n', 'telegram of Port Said, declaring that I have done you no harm.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Madame has you well in hand. Would you stick a knife into me if you had the\\n', 'chance?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have no chance,\" said the Greek. \"She is there with that woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I see. It\\'s a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the chance of\\n', 'loot. I sympathise with you, George.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They went to the telegraph-office unquestioned, for all the world was\\n', 'desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head, and Suakin was the\\n', 'last place under sky that would be chosen for holiday-ground. On their return\\n', 'the voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was doing. The blue\\n', \"goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on George's elbow as he\\n\", 'replied--\"Egyptian Government--mules. My orders are to give them over to the A.\\n', 'C. G. at Tanai-el-Hassan. Any occasion to show my papers?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, certainly not. I beg your pardon. I\\'d no right to ask, but not seeing your\\n', 'face before I----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I go out in the train tonight, I suppose,\" said Dick, boldly. \"There will be\\n', 'no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You can see the horse-platforms from here. You must have them loaded up\\n', 'early.\" The young man went away wondering what sort of broken-down waif this\\n', 'might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek muleteers. Dick\\n', 'felt unhappy. To outface an English officer is no small thing, but the bluff\\n', 'loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark, and stumbles up and down\\n', 'rough ways, thinking and eternally thinking of what might have been if things\\n', 'had fallen out otherwise, and all had been as it was not.\\n', '\\n', 'George shared his meal with Dick and went off to the mule-lines. His charge sat\\n', 'alone in a shed with his face in his hands. Before his tight-shut eyes danced\\n', 'the face of Maisie, laughing, with parted lips. There was a great bustle and\\n', 'clamour about him. He grew afraid and almost called for George.\\n', '\\n', '\"I say, have you got your mules ready?\" It was the voice of the subaltern over\\n', 'his shoulder.\\n', '\\n', '\"My man\\'s looking after them. The--the fact is I\\'ve a touch of ophthalmia and\\n', \"can't see very well.\\n\", '\\n', '\"By Jove! that\\'s bad. You ought to lie up in hospital for a while. I\\'ve had a\\n', 'turn of it myself. It\\'s as bad as being blind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"So I find it. When does this armoured train go?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"At six o\"clock. It takes an hour to cover the seven miles.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are the Fuzzies on the rampage--eh?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"About three nights a week. Fact is I\\'m in acting command of the night-train.\\n', 'It generally runs back empty to Tanai for the night.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Big camp at Tanai, I suppose?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Pretty big. It has to feed our desert-column somehow.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is that far off?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Between thirty and forty miles--in an infernal thirsty country.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is the country quiet between Tanai and our men?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"More or less. I shouldn\\'t care to cross it alone, or with a subaltern\"s\\n', 'command for the matter of that, but the scouts get through it in some\\n', 'extraordinary fashion.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They always did.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Have you been here before, then?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I was through most of the trouble when it first broke out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In the service and cashiered,\" was the subaltern\\'s first thought, so he\\n', 'refrained from putting any questions.\\n', '\\n', '\"There\\'s your man coming up with the mules. It seems rather queer----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That I should be mule-leading?\" said Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"I didn\\'t mean to say so, but it is. Forgive me--it\\'s beastly impertinence I\\n', 'know, but you speak like a man who has been at a public school. There\"s no\\n', 'mistaking the tone.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am a public school man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I thought so. I say, I don\\'t want to hurt your feelings, but you\\'re a little\\n', \"down on your luck, aren't you? I saw you sitting with your head in your hands,\\n\", 'and that\\'s why I spoke.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Thanks. I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Suppose--I mean I\\'m a public school man myself. Couldn\\'t I perhaps--take it as\\n', 'a loan y\\'know and----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You\\'re much too good, but on my honour I\\'ve as much money as I want.\\n', '\\n', '. . . I tell you what you could do for me, though, and put me under an\\n', 'everlasting obligation. Let me come into the bogie truck of the train.\\n', '\\n', 'There is a fore-truck, isn\\'t there?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes. How d\\'you know?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve been in an armoured train before. Only let me see--hear some of the fun I\\n', 'mean, and I\\'ll be grateful. I go at my own risk as a non-combatant.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The young man thought for a minute. \"All right,\" he said. \"We\\'re supposed to be\\n', 'an empty train, and there\\'s no one to blow me up at the other end.\"\\n', '\\n', 'George and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the mules, and\\n', 'the narrow-gauge armoured train, plated with three-eighths inch boiler-plate\\n', 'till it looked like one long coffin, stood ready to start.\\n', '\\n', 'Two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered in with\\n', 'plating, except that the leading one was pierced in front for the muzzle of a\\n', 'machine-gun, and the second at either side for lateral fire.\\n', '\\n', 'The trucks together made one long iron-vaulted chamber in which a score of\\n', 'artillerymen were rioting.\\n', '\\n', '\"Whitechapel--last train! Ah, I see yer kissin\" in the first class there!\"\\n', 'somebody shouted, just as Dick was clamouring into the forward truck.\\n', '\\n', '\"Lordy! \\'Ere\\'s a real live passenger for the Kew, Tanai, Acton, and Ealin\\'\\n', 'train. Echo, sir. Speshul edition! Star, sir.\"--\"Shall I get you a foot-\\n', 'warmer?\" said another.\\n', '\\n', '\"Thanks. I\\'ll pay my footing,\" said Dick, and relations of the most amiable\\n', 'were established ere silence came with the arrival of the subaltern, and the\\n', 'train jolted out over the rough track.\\n', '\\n', '\"This is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy in the\\n', 'open,\" said Dick, from his place in the corner.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, but he\\'s still unimpressed. There he goes!\" said the subaltern, as a\\n', 'bullet struck the outside of the truck. \"We always have at least one\\n', 'demonstration against the night-train. Generally they attack the rear-truck,\\n', 'where my junior commands. He gets all the fun of the fair.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not tonight though! Listen!\" said Dick. A flight of heavy-handed bullets was\\n', 'succeeded by yelling and shouts. The children of the desert valued their\\n', 'nightly amusement, and the train was an excellent mark.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is it worth giving them half a hopper full?\" the subaltern asked of the\\n', 'engine, which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers.\\n', '\\n', '\"I should think so! This is my section of the line. They\\'ll be playing old\\n', 'Harry with my permanent way if we don\\'t stop \"em.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Right O!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hrrmph!\" said the machine gun through all its five noses as the subaltern drew\\n', 'the lever home. The empty cartridges clashed on the floor and the smoke blew\\n', 'back through the truck. There was indiscriminate firing at the rear of the\\n', 'train, and return fire from the darkness without and unlimited howling. Dick\\n', 'stretched himself on the floor, wild with delight at the sounds and the smells.\\n', '\\n', '\"God is very good--I never thought I\\'d hear this again. Give \\'em hell, men. Oh,\\n', 'give \\'em hell!\" he cried.\\n', '\\n', 'The train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party went out\\n', 'to reconnoitre, but came back, cursing, for spades. The children of the desert\\n', 'had piled sand and gravel on the rails, and twenty minutes were lost in\\n', 'clearing it away. Then the slow progress recommenced, to be varied with more\\n', 'shots, more shoutings, the steady clack and kick of the machine guns, and a\\n', 'final difficulty with a half-lifted rail ere the train came under the\\n', 'protection of the roaring camp at Tanai-el-Hassan.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now, you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through,\" said the\\n', 'subaltern, unshipping the cartridge-hopper above his pet gun.\\n', '\\n', '\"It was a lark, though. I only wish it had lasted twice as long. How superb it\\n', 'must have looked from outside!\" said Dick, sighing regretfully.\\n', '\\n', '\"It palls after the first few nights. By the way, when you\\'ve settled about\\n', 'your mules, come and see what we can find to eat in my tent. I\"m Bennil of the\\n', \"Gunners--in the artillery lines--and mind you don't fall over my tent-ropes in\\n\", 'the dark.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But it was all dark to Dick. He could only smell the camels, the hay-bales, the\\n', 'cooking, the smoky fires, and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood, where\\n', 'he had dropped from the train, shouting for George. There was a sound of light-\\n', 'hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks, with squealing and\\n', 'grunting. George was unloading the mules.\\n', '\\n', \"The engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dick's ear; a cold wind of the\\n\", 'desert danced between his legs; he was hungry, and felt tired and dirty--so\\n', 'dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands. That was a hopeless job;\\n', 'he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count over the many times\\n', 'that he had waited in strange or remote places for trains or camels, mules or\\n', 'horses, to carry him to his business. In those days he could see--few men more\\n', 'clearly--and the spectacle of an armed camp at dinner under the stare was an\\n', 'ever fresh pleasure to the eye. There was colour, light, and motion, without\\n', 'which no man has much pleasure in living. This night there remained for him\\n', 'only one more journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how\\n', \"far he has travelled. Then he would grip Torpenhow's hand again--Torpenhow, who\\n\", 'was alive and strong, and lived in the midst of the action that had once made\\n', 'the reputation of a man called Dick Heldar: not in the least to be confused\\n', 'with the blind, bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to the same name. Yes,\\n', 'he would find Torpenhow, and come as near to the old life as might be.\\n', 'Afterwards he would forget everything: Bessie, who had wrecked the Melancolia\\n', 'and so nearly wrecked his life; Beeton, who lived in a strange unreal city full\\n', 'of tin-tacks and gas-plugs and matters that no men needed; that irrational\\n', 'being who had offered him love and loyalty for nothing, but had not signed her\\n', 'name; and most of all Maisie, who, from her own point of view, was undeniably\\n', 'right in all she did, but oh, at this distance, so tantalisingly fair.\\n', '\\n', \"George's hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation.\\n\", '\\n', '\"And what now?\" said George.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh yes of course. What now? Take me to the camel-men. Take me to where the\\n', 'scouts sit when they come in from the desert. They sit by their camels, and the\\n', 'camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners, and the men eat\\n', 'by their side just like camels. Take me there!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The camp was rough and rutty, and Dick stumbled many times over the stumps of\\n', 'scrub. The scouts were sitting by their beasts, as Dick knew they would. The\\n', 'light of the dung-fires flickered on their bearded faces, and the camels\\n', \"bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest. It was no part of Dick's policy to go\\n\", 'into the desert with a convoy of supplies. That would lead to impertinent\\n', 'questions, and since a blind non-combatant is not needed at the front, he would\\n', 'probably be forced to return to Suakin.\\n', '\\n', 'He must go up alone, and go immediately.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now for one last bluff--the biggest of all,\" he said. \"Peace be with you,\\n', 'brethren!\" The watchful George steered him to the circle of the nearest fire.\\n', 'The heads of the camel-sheiks bowed gravely, and the camels, scenting a\\n', 'European, looked sideways curiously like brooding hens, half ready to get to\\n', 'their feet.\\n', '\\n', '\"A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight,\" said Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"A Mulaid?\" said a voice, scornfully naming the best baggage-breed that he\\n', 'knew.\\n', '\\n', '\"A Bisharin,\" returned Dick, with perfect gravity. \"A Bisharin without saddle-\\n', 'galls. Therefore no charge of thine, shock-head.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Two or three minutes passed. Then--\"We be knee-haltered for the night. There is\\n', 'no going out from the camp.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not for money?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"H\\'m! Ah! English money?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Another depressing interval of silence.\\n', '\\n', '\"How much?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Twenty-five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my journey\\'s\\n', 'end, and as much more into the hand of the camel-sheik here, to be paid when\\n', 'the driver returns.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was royal payment, and the sheik, who knew that he would get his\\n', \"commission on this deposit, stirred in Dick's behalf.\\n\", '\\n', '\"For scarcely one night\\'s journey--fifty pounds. Land and wells and good trees\\n', 'and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days. Who speaks?\" said\\n', 'Dick.\\n', '\\n', '\"I,\" said a voice. \"I will go--but there is no going from the camp.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Fool! I know that a camel can break his knee-halter, and the sentries do not\\n', 'fire if one goes in chase. Twenty-five pounds and another twenty-five pounds.\\n', 'But the beast must be a good Bisharin; I will take no baggage-camel.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then the bargaining began, and at the end of half an hour the first deposit was\\n', 'paid over to the sheik, who talked in low tones to the driver.\\n', '\\n', 'Dick heard the latter say: \"A little way out only. Any baggage-beast will\\n', 'serve. Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And though I cannot see\"--Dick lifted his voice a little--\"yet I carry that\\n', 'which has six eyes, and the driver will sit before me. If we do not reach the\\n', 'English troops in the dawn he will be dead.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But where, in God\\'s name, are the troops?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Unless thou knowest let another man ride. Dost thou know? Remember it will be\\n', 'life or death to thee.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know,\" said the driver, sullenly. \"Stand back from my beast. I am going to\\n', 'slip him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not so swiftly. George, hold the camel\\'s head a moment. I want to feel his\\n', 'cheek.\" The hands wandered over the hide till they found the branded half-\\n', 'circle that is the mark of the Biharin, the light-built riding-camel.\\n', '\\n', '\"That is well. Cut this one loose. Remember no blessing of God comes on those\\n', 'who try to cheat the blind.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The men chuckled by the fires at the camel-driver's discomfiture. He had\\n\", 'intended to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt.\\n', '\\n', '\"Stand back!\" one shouted, lashing the Biharin under the belly with a quirt.\\n', 'Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose-string tighten in his hand,--and a cry\\n', 'went up, \"Illaha! Aho! He is loose.\"\\n', '\\n', 'With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward toward\\n', 'the desert, his driver following with shouts and lamentation.\\n', '\\n', \"George caught Dick's arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a\\n\", 'disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels.\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s the row now?\" he cried.\\n', '\\n', '\"Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary,\" Dick answered, after the\\n', 'manner of a common soldier.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go on, and take care your throat\\'s not cut outside--you and your dromedary\"s.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock, and his\\n', 'driver had called him back and made him kneel down.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mount first,\" said Dick. Then climbing into the second seat and gently\\n', 'screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion\\'s back, \"Go on in\\n', \"God's name, and swiftly. Goodbye, George. Remember me to Madame, and have a\\n\", 'good time with your girl. Get forward, child of the Pit!\"\\n', '\\n', 'A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence, hardly broken by the\\n', 'creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet. Dick adjusted\\n', 'himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace, girthed his belt\\n', 'tighter, and felt the darkness slide past. For an hour he was conscious only of\\n', 'the sense of rapid progress.\\n', '\\n', '\"A good camel,\" he said at last.\\n', '\\n', '\"He was never underfed. He is my own and clean bred,\" the driver replied.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go on.\"\\n', '\\n', 'His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think, but the tenor of his\\n', 'thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy. In the half doze in seemed that\\n', \"he was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs. Jennett's. He had committed some\\n\", 'crime as bad as Sabbath-breaking, and she had locked him up in his bedroom. But\\n', 'he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the hymn--\\n', '\\n', 'When Israel of the Lord believed\\n', 'Out of the land of bondage came.\\n', '\\n', 'He said them over and over thousands of times. The driver turned in the saddle\\n', 'to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and ending the ride.\\n', 'Dick roused, struck him over the head with the butt, and stormed himself wide\\n', 'awake. Somebody hidden in a clump of camel-thorn shouted as the camel toiled up\\n', 'rising ground. A shot was fired, and the silence shut down again, bringing the\\n', 'desire to sleep. Dick could think no longer. He was too tired and stiff and\\n', 'cramped to do more than nod uneasily from time to time, waking with a start and\\n', 'punching the driver with the pistol.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is there a moon?\" he asked drowsily.\\n', '\\n', '\"She is near her setting.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish that I could see her. Halt the camel. At least let me hear the desert\\n', 'talk.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man obeyed. Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind. It rattled\\n', 'the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased. A handful of dry\\n', 'earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and crumbled softly to the\\n', 'bottom.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go on. The night is very cold.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the light\\n', 'lengthens itself into many eternities. It seemed to Dick that he had never\\n', 'since the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save jolt through\\n', 'the air. Once in a thousand years he would finger the nailheads on the saddle-\\n', 'front and count them all carefully. Centuries later he would shift his revolver\\n', 'from his right hand to his left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his\\n', 'side. From the safe distance of London he was watching himself thus employed,--\\n', 'watching critically. Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he\\n', 'might paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon, the\\n', 'black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop, that hand held a\\n', 'revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collar-bone. Moreover, he was in\\n', 'the dark, and could see no canvas of any kind whatever.\\n', '\\n', 'The driver grunted, and Dick was conscious of a change in the air.\\n', '\\n', '\"I smell the dawn,\" he whispered.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is here, and yonder are the troops. Have I done well?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the pungent\\n', 'reek of camels in the square.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go on. We must get there swiftly. Go on.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They are moving in their camp. There is so much dust that I cannot see what\\n', 'they do.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Am I in better case? Go forward.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They could hear the hum of voices ahead, the howling and the bubbling of the\\n', 'beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day.\\n', '\\n', 'Two or three shots were fired.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is that at us? Surely they can see that I am English,\" Dick spoke angrily.\\n', '\\n', '\"Nay, it is from the desert,\" the driver answered, cowering in his saddle.\\n', '\\n', '\"Go forward, my child! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour\\n', 'ago.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied. The\\n', 'children of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises, a\\n', 'dawn attack for the English troops, and were getting their distance by snap-\\n', 'shots at the only moving object without the square.\\n', '\\n', '\"What luck! What stupendous and imperial luck!\" said Dick. \"It\\'s \\'just before\\n', 'the battle, mother.\\' Oh, God has been most good to me! Only\"--the agony of the\\n', 'thought made him screw up his eyes for an instant--\"Maisie . . .\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Allahu! We are in,\" said the man, as he drove into the rearguard and the camel\\n', 'knelt.\\n', '\\n', '\"Who the deuce are you? Despatches or what? What\\'s the strength of the enemy\\n', 'behind that ridge? How did you get through?\" asked a dozen voices. For all\\n', 'answer Dick took a long breath, unbuckled his belt, and shouted from the saddle\\n', 'at the top of a wearied and dusty voice, \"Torpenhow! Ohe, Torp! Coo-ee, Tor-\\n', 'pen-how.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved very\\n', 'swiftly towards that cry, as the rearguard, facing about, began to fire at the\\n', 'puffs of smoke from the hillocks around. Gradually the scattered white\\n', 'cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white that hung heavily in the\\n', 'stillness of the dawn before they turned over wave-like and glided into the\\n', 'valleys. The soldiers in the square were coughing and swearing as their own\\n', 'smoke obstructed their view, and they edged forward to get beyond it.

Forty miles away, untouched by cloud or storm, the\\n', 'white shoulder of Dongo Pa--the Mountain of the Council of the Gods--upheld the\\n', 'evening star. The monkeys sung sorrowfully to each other as they hunted for dry\\n', 'roots in the fern-draped trees, and the last puff of the day-wind brought from\\n', 'the unseen villages the scent of damp wood smoke, hot cakes, dripping\\n', 'undergrowth, and rotting pine-cones. That smell is the true smell of the\\n', 'Himalayas, and if it once gets into the blood of a man he will, at the last,\\n', 'forgetting everything else, return to the Hills to die. The clouds closed and\\n', 'the smell went away, and there remained nothing in all the world except\\n', 'chilling white mists and the boom of the Sutlej River.\\n', '\\n', 'A fat-tailed sheep, who did not want to die, bleated lamentably at my tent-\\n', 'door. He was scuffling with the prime minister and the director-general of\\n', 'public education, and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants. I\\n', 'expressed my thanks suitably and inquired if I might have audience of the king.\\n', 'The prime minister readjusted his turban--it had fallen off in the struggle--\\n', 'and assured me that the king would be very pleased to see me. Therefore I\\n', 'dispatched two bottles as a foretaste, and when the sheep had entered upon\\n', \"another incarnation, climbed up to the king's palace through the wet. He had\\n\", 'sent his army to escort me, but it stayed to talk with my cook. Soldiers are\\n', 'very much alike all the world over.\\n', '\\n', 'The palace was a four-roomed, white-washed mud-and-timber house, the finest in\\n', \"all the Hills for a day's journey. The king was dressed in a purple velvet\\n\", 'jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban of price. He gave me\\n', 'audience in a little carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard, which was\\n', 'occupied by the elephant of state. The great beast was sheeted and anchored\\n', 'from trunk to tail, and the curve of his back stood out against the sky line.\\n', '\\n', 'The prime minister and the director-general of public instruction were present\\n', 'to introduce me; but all the court had been dismissed lest the two bottles\\n', 'aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The king cast a wreath of heavy, scented\\n', 'flowers round my neck as I bowed, and inquired how my honored presence had the\\n', 'felicity to be. I said that through seeing his auspicious countenance the mists\\n', 'of the night had turned into sunshine, and that by reason of his beneficent\\n', 'sheep his good deeds would be remembered by the gods. He said that since I had\\n', 'set my magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy\\n', 'per cent more than the average. I said that the fame of the king had reached to\\n', 'the four corners of the earth, and that the nations gnashed their teeth when\\n', 'they heard daily of the glory of his realm and the wisdom of his moon-like\\n', 'prime minister and lotus-eyed director-general of public education.\\n', '\\n', \"Then we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the king's right hand.\\n\", 'Three minutes later he was telling me that the condition of the maize crop was\\n', 'something disgraceful, and that the railway companies would not pay him enough\\n', 'for his timber. The talk shifted to and fro with the bottles. We discussed very\\n', 'many quaint things, and the king became confidential on the subject of\\n', 'government generally. Most of all he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his\\n', 'subjects, who, from what I could gather, had been paralyzing the executive.\\n', '\\n', '\"In the old days,\" said the king, \"I could have ordered the elephant yonder to\\n', \"trample him to death. Now I must e'en send him seventy miles across the hills\\n\", 'to be tried, and his keep for that time would be upon the state. And the\\n', 'elephant eats everything.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What be the man\\'s crimes, Rajah Sahib?\" said I.\\n', '\\n', '\"Firstly, he is an \\'outlander,\\' and no man of mine own people. Secondly, since\\n', 'of my favor I gave him land upon his coming, he refuses to pay revenue. Am I\\n', 'not the lord of the earth, above and below--entitled by right and custom to\\n', 'one-eighth of the crop? Yet this devil, establishing himself, refuses to pay a\\n', 'single tax . . . and he brings a poisonous spawn of babes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Cast him into jail,\" I said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Sahib,\" the king answered, shifting a little on the cushions, \"once and only\\n', 'once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not able to go\\n', 'abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would never again cut man or\\n', 'woman from the light of the sun and the air of God, for I perceived the nature\\n', 'of the punishment. How can I break my vow? Were it only the lopping off of a\\n', 'hand or a foot, I should not delay. But even that is impossible now that the\\n', 'English have rule. One or another of my people\"--he looked obliquely at the\\n', 'director-general of public education--\"would at once write a letter to the\\n', 'viceroy, and perhaps I should be deprived of that ruffle of drums.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain amber one,\\n', 'and passed the pipe to me. \"Not content with refusing revenue,\" he continued,\\n', '\"this outlander refuses also to beegar\" (this is the corvee or forced labor on\\n', 'the roads), \"and stirs my people up to the like treason. Yet he is, if so he\\n', 'wills, an expert log-snatcher. There is none better or bolder among my people\\n', 'to clear a block of the river when the logs stick fast.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But he worships strange gods,\" said the prime minister, deferentially.\\n', '\\n', '\"For that I have no concern,\" said the king, who was as tolerant as Akbar in\\n', 'matters of belief. \"To each man his own god, and the fire or Mother Earth for\\n', 'us all at the last. It is the rebellion that offends me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The king has an army,\" I suggested. \"Has not the king burned the man\\'s house,\\n', 'and left him naked to the night dews?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nay. A hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once I sent my army\\n', 'against him when his excuses became wearisome. Of their heads he brake three\\n', 'across the top with a stick. The other two men ran away. Also the guns would\\n', 'not shoot.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old muzzle-\\n', 'loading fowling-piece with ragged rust holes where the nipples should have\\n', 'been; one-third a wirebound matchlock with a worm-eaten stock, and one-third a\\n', 'four-bore flint duck-gun, without a flint.\\n', '\\n', '\"But it is to be remembered,\" said the king, reaching out for the bottle, \"that\\n', 'he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry face. What shall I do to\\n', 'him, sahib?\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused taxes to\\n', 'their king as offerings to their gods. The rebel must be a man of character.\\n', '\\n', '\"If it be the king\\'s permission,\" I said, \"I will not strike my tents till the\\n', 'third day, and I will see this man. The mercy of the king is godlike, and\\n', 'rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover, both the bottles, and\\n', 'another, be empty.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have my leave to go,\" said the king.\\n', '\\n', 'Next morning the crier went through the stare proclaiming that there was a log-\\n', 'jam on the river and that it behooved all loyal subjects to clear it. The\\n', 'people poured down from their villages to the moist, warm valley of poppy\\n', 'fields, and the king and I went with them.\\n', '\\n', 'Hundreds of dressed deodar logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the river was\\n', 'bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade. The water\\n', 'snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber, while the population of the\\n', 'state prodded at the nearest logs with poles, in the hope of easing the\\n', 'pressure. Then there went up a shout of \"Namgay Doola! Namgay Doola!\" and a\\n', 'large, red-haired villager hurried up, stripping off his clothes as he ran.\\n', '\\n', '\"That he is. That is the rebel!\" said the king. \"Now will the dam be cleared.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But why has he red hair?\" I asked, since red hair among hill-folk is as\\n', 'uncommon as blue or green.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is an outlander,\" said the king. \"Well done! Oh, well done!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Namgay Doola had scrambled on the jam and was clawing out the butt of a log\\n', 'with a rude sort of a boat-hook. It slid forward slowly, as an alligator moves,\\n', 'and three or four others followed it. The green water spouted through the gaps.\\n', 'Then the villagers howled and shouted and leaped among the logs, pulling and\\n', 'pushing the obstinate timber, and the red head of Namgay Doola was chief among\\n', 'them all. The logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from up-\\n', 'stream battered the now weakening dam. It gave way at last in a smother of\\n', 'foam, racing butts, bobbing black heads, and a confusion indescribable, as the\\n', 'river tossed everything before it. I saw the red head go down with the last\\n', 'remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks. It\\n', 'rose close to the hank, and blowing like a grampus, Namgay Doola wiped the\\n', 'water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king.\\n', '\\n', 'I had time to observe the man closely. The virulent redness of his shock head\\n', 'and beard was most startling, and in the thicket of hair twinkled above high\\n', 'cheek-bones two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an outlander, but yet a\\n', 'Thibetan in language, habit and attire. He spoke the Lepcha dialect with an\\n', 'indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was not so much a lisp as an\\n', 'accent.\\n', '\\n', '\"Whence comest thou?\" I asked, wondering.\\n', '\\n', '\"From Thibet.\" He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin went straight\\n', 'to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola took it. No pure\\n', 'Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the gesture. He went away to look\\n', 'for his clothes, and as he climbed back to his village, I heard a joyous yell\\n', 'that seemed unaccountably familiar. It was the whooping of Namgay Doola.\\n', '\\n', '\"You see now,\" said the king, \"why I would not kill him. He is a bold man among\\n', 'my logs, but,\" and he shook his head like a schoolmaster, \"I know that before\\n', 'long there will be complaints of him in the court. Let us return to the palace\\n', 'and do justice.\"\\n', '\\n', \"It was that king's custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven and\\n\", \"three o'clock. I heard him do justice equitably on weighty matters of trespass,\\n\", 'slander, and a little wife-stealing. Then his brow clouded and he summoned me.\\n', '\\n', '\"Again it is Namgay Doola,\" he said, despairingly. \"Not content with refusing\\n', 'revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an oath to the like\\n', 'treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me! Nor are my taxes heavy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear, advanced\\n', \"trembling. He had been in Namgay Doola's conspiracy, but had told everything\\n\", \"and hoped for the king's favor.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Oh, king!\" said I, \"if it be the king\\'s will, let this matter stand over till\\n', 'the morning. Only the gods can do right in a hurry, and it may be that yonder\\n', 'villager has lied.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks, let the\\n', 'matter remain. Wilt thou, for my sake, speak harshly to this red-headed\\n', 'outlander? He may listen to thee.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could not keep my\\n', 'countenance. Namgay Doola grinned so persuasively and began to tell me about a\\n', 'big brown bear in a poppy field by the river. Would I care to shoot that bear?\\n', 'I spoke austerely on the sin of detected conspiracy and the certainty of\\n', \"punishment. Namgay Doola's face clouded for a moment. Shortly afterward he\\n\", 'withdrew from my tent, and I heard him singing softly among the pines. The\\n', 'words were unintelligible to me, but the tune, like his liquid, insinuating\\n', 'speech, seemed the ghost of something strangely familiar.\\n', '\\n', '\"Dir hane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee,\"\\n', '\\n', 'crooned Namgay Doola again and again, and I racked my brain for that lost tune.\\n', 'It was not till after dinner that I discovered some one had cut a square foot\\n', 'of velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made me so angry that I\\n', 'wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown bear. I could\\n', 'hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy field as I waited\\n', 'shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch him after his meal. The\\n', 'moon was at full and drew out the scent of the tasseled crop. Then I heard the\\n', 'anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow--one of the little black crummies no bigger\\n', 'than Newfoundland dogs. Two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried\\n', 'past me. I was in the act of firing when I saw that each bore a brilliant red\\n', 'head. The lesser animal was trailing something rope-like that left a dark track\\n', 'on the path. They were within six feet of me, and the shadow of the moonlight\\n', 'lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly the word, for by all\\n', 'the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my camera-cloth. I\\n', 'marveled, and went to bed.\\n', '\\n', 'Next morning the kingdom was in an uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had gone\\n', 'forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow\\n', 'belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was sacrilege\\n', 'unspeakable against the holy cow. The state desired his blood, but he had\\n', 'retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with big stones, and\\n', 'defied the world.\\n', '\\n', 'The king and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously. There was no\\n', 'hope of capturing our man without loss of life, for from a hole in the wall\\n', 'projected the muzzle of an extremely well-cared-for gun--the only gun in the\\n', 'state that could shoot. Namgay Doola had narrowly missed a villager just before\\n', 'we came up.\\n', '\\n', 'The standing army stood.\\n', '\\n', 'It could do no more, for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the\\n', 'windows. To these were added from time to time showers of scalding water. We\\n', 'saw red beads bobbing up and down within. The family of Namgay Doola were\\n', 'aiding their sire. Blood-curdling yells of defiance were the only answer to our\\n', 'prayers.\\n', '\\n', '\"Never,\" said the king, puffing, \"has such a thing befallen my state. Next year\\n', 'I will certainly buy a little cannon.\" He looked at me imploringly.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen?\" said I, for a\\n', 'light was beginning to break upon me.\\n', '\\n', '\"He worships his own god,\" said the prime minister. \"We can but starve him\\n', 'out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let the white man approach,\" said Namgay Doola from within. \"All others I will\\n', 'kill. Send me the white man.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan hut\\n', 'crammed with children. And every child had flaming red hair. A freshgathered\\n', \"cow's tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces of black velvet--my\\n\", 'black velvet--rudely hacked into the semblance of masks.\\n', '\\n', '\"And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', 'He grinned more charmingly than ever. \"There is no shame,\" said he. \"I did but\\n', \"cut off the tail of that man's cow. He betrayed me. I was minded to shoot him,\\n\", 'sahib, but not to death. Indeed, not to death; only in the legs.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king? Why at\\n', 'all?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"By the god of my father, I cannot tell,\" said Namgay Doola.\\n', '\\n', '\"And who was thy father?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The same that had this gun.\" He showed me his weapon, a Tower musket, bearing\\n', 'date 1832 and the stamp of the Honorable East India Company.\\n', '\\n', '\"And thy father\\'s name?\" said I.\\n', '\\n', 'He obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came.\\n', '\"Thimla Dhula!\" said he, excitedly. \"To this hour I worship his god.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"May I see that god?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In a little while--at twilight time.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Rememberest thou aught of thy father\\'s speech?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is long ago. But there was one word which he said often. Thus, \\'\\'Shun!\\'\\n', 'Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to our sides, thus.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Even so. And what was thy mother?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A woman of the Hills. We be Lepchas of Darjiling, but me they call an\\n', 'outlander because my hair is as thou seest.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long parley\\n', 'outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close upon twilight--\\n', 'the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly the red-headed brats rose from the floor\\n', 'and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid his gun aside, lighted a little oil-\\n', 'lamp, and set it before a recess in the wall. Pulling back a wisp of dirty\\n', 'cloth, he revealed a worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmet badge of a\\n', 'long-forgotten East India Company\\'s regiment. \"Thus did my father,\" he said,\\n', 'crossing himself clumsily. The wife and children followed suit. Then, all\\n', 'together, they struck up the wailing cham that I heard on the hillside:\\n', '\\n', '\"Dir bane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was puzzled no longer. Again and again they sung, as if their hearts would\\n', 'break, their version of the chorus of \"The Wearing of the Green\":\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'re hanging men and women, too, For the wearing of the green,.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about eight years\\n', 'old--could he have been in the fields last night?--was watching me as he sung.\\n', 'I pulled out a rupee, held the coin between finger and thumb, and looked--only\\n', 'looked--at the gun leaning against the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect\\n', 'comprehension overspread his porringer-like face. Never for an instant stopping\\n', 'the song, he held out his hand for the money, and then slid the gun to my hand.\\n', 'I might have shot Namgay Doola dead as he chanted, but I was satisfied. The\\n', 'inevitable blood-instinct held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain across the\\n', 'recess. Angelus was over.\\n', '\\n', '\"Thus my father sung. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and I do not\\n', 'know the purport of even these words, but it may be that the god will\\n', 'understand.

Without warning, for no conceivable motive,\\n', 'in his youth and at the threshold of his career he had chosen to disappear from\\n', 'the world--which is to say, the little Indian station where he lived. Upon a\\n', 'day he was alive, well, happy, and in great evidence at his club, among the\\n', 'billiard-tables. Upon a morning he was not, and no manner of search could make\\n', 'sure where he might be. He had stepped out of his place; he had not appeared at\\n', 'his office at the proper time, and his dog-cart was not upon the public roads.\\n', 'For these reasons and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the\\n', 'administration of the Indian Empire, the Indian Empire paused for one\\n', 'microscopical moment to make inquiry into the fate of Imray. Ponds were\\n', 'dragged, wells were plumbed, telegrams were dispatched down the lines of\\n', 'railways and to the nearest seaport town--1,200 miles away--but Imray was not\\n', 'at the end of the drag-ropes nor the telegrams. He was gone, and his place knew\\n', 'him no more. Then the work of the great Indian Empire swept forward, because it\\n', 'could not be delayed, and Imray, from being a man, became a mystery--such a\\n', 'thing as men talk over at their tables in the club for a month and then forget\\n', 'utterly. His guns, horses, and carts were sold to the highest bidder. His\\n', 'superior officer wrote an absurd letter to his mother, saying that Imray had\\n', 'unaccountably disappeared and his bungalow stood empty on the road.\\n', '\\n', 'After three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by, my friend\\n', 'Strickland, of the police force, saw fit to rent the bungalow from the native\\n', 'landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal--an affair which has\\n', 'been described in another place--and while he was pursuing his investigations\\n', 'into native life. His own life was sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of\\n', 'his manners and customs. There was always food in his house, but there were no\\n', 'regular times for meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he\\n', 'might find on the sideboard, and this is not good for the insides of human\\n', 'beings. His domestic equipment was limited to six rifles, three shotguns, five\\n', 'saddles, and a collection of stiff-jointed masheer rods, bigger and stronger\\n', 'than the largest salmon rods. These things occupied one half of his bungalow,\\n', 'and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog Tietjens--an enormous\\n', 'Rampur slut, who sung when she was ordered, and devoured daily the rations of\\n', 'two men. She spoke to Strickland in a language of her own, and whenever, in her\\n', 'walks abroad she saw things calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the\\n', 'Queen Empress, she returned to her master and gave him information. Strickland\\n', 'would take steps at once, and the end of his labors was trouble and fine and\\n', 'imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was a\\n', 'familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born of hate\\n', 'and fear One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use. She owned\\n', 'a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking-trough, and if any one came into\\n', \"Strickland's room at night, her custom was to knock down the invader and give\\n\", 'tongue till some one came with a light.

From that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a\\n', 'monogram on her night blanket, and the blanket was double-woven Kashmir cloth,\\n', 'for she was a delicate dog.\\n', '\\n', 'Under no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland, and when he was\\n', 'ill with fever she made great trouble for the doctors because she did not know\\n', 'how to help her master and would not allow another creature to attempt aid.\\n', 'Macarnaght, of the Indian Medical Service, beat her over the head with a gun,\\n', 'before she could understand that she must give room for those who could give\\n', 'quinine.\\n', '\\n', \"A short time after Strickland had taken Imray's bungalow, my business took me\\n\", 'through that station, and naturally, the club quarters being full, I quartered\\n', 'myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow, eight-roomed, and heavily\\n', 'thatched against any chance of leakage from rain. Under the pitch of the roof\\n', 'ran a ceiling cloth, which looked just as nice as a whitewashed ceiling. The\\n', 'landlord had repainted it when Strickland took the bungalow, and unless you\\n', 'knew how Indian bungalows were built you would never have suspected that above\\n', 'the cloth lay the dark, three-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and\\n', 'the under side of the thatch harbored all manner of rats, hats, ants, and other\\n', 'things.\\n', '\\n', 'Tietjens met me in the veranda with a bay like the boom of the bells of St.\\n', \"Paul's, and put her paws on my shoulders and said she was glad to see me.\\n\", 'Strickland had contrived to put together that sort of meal which he called\\n', 'lunch, and immediately after it was finished went out about his business. I was\\n', 'left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs. The heat of the summer had broken\\n', 'up and given place to the warm damp of the rains. There was no motion in the\\n', 'heated air, but the rain fell like bayonet rods on the earth, and flung up a\\n', 'blue mist where it splashed back again. The bamboos and the custard apples, the\\n', 'poinsettias and the mango-trees in the garden stood still while the warm water\\n', 'lashed through them, and the frogs began to sing among the aloe hedges. A\\n', 'little before the light failed, and when the rain was at its worst, I sat in\\n', 'the back veranda and heard the water roar from the eaves, and scratched myself\\n', 'because I was covered with the thing they called prickly heat. Tietjens came\\n', 'out with me and put her head in my lap, and was very sorrowful, so I gave her\\n', 'biscuits when tea was ready, and I took tea in the back veranda on account of\\n', 'the little coolness I found there. The rooms of the house were dark behind me.\\n', \"I could smell Strickland's saddlery and the oil on his guns, and I did not the\\n\", 'least desire to sit among these things. My own servant came to me in the\\n', 'twilight, the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched body, and\\n', 'told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some one. Very much\\n', 'against my will, and because of the darkness of the rooms, I went into the\\n', 'naked drawing-room, telling my man to bring the lights. There might or might\\n', 'not have been a caller in the room--it seems to me that I saw a figure by one\\n', 'of the windows, but when the lights came there was nothing save the spikes of\\n', 'the rain without and the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils. I\\n', 'explained to my man that he was no wiser than he ought to be, and went back to\\n', 'the veranda to talk to Tietjens. She had gone out into the wet and I could\\n', 'hardly coax her back to me--even with biscuits with sugar on top. Strickland\\n', 'rode back, dripping wet, just before dinner, and the first thing he said was:\\n', '\\n', 'Has any one called?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I explained, with apologies, that my servant had called me into the drawing-\\n', 'room on a false alarm; or that some loafer had tried to call on Strickland,\\n', 'and, thinking better of it, fled after giving his name. Strickland ordered\\n', 'dinner without comment, and since it was a real dinner, with white tablecloth\\n', 'attached, we sat down.\\n', '\\n', \"At nine o'clock Strickland wanted to go to bed, and I was tired too. Tietjens,\\n\", 'who had been lying underneath the table, rose up and went into the least\\n', 'exposed veranda as soon as her master moved to his own room, which was next to\\n', 'the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens. If a mere wife had wished to sleep\\n', 'out-of-doors in that pelting rain, it would not have mattered, but Tietjens was\\n', 'a dog, and therefore the better animal. I looked at Strickland, expecting to\\n', 'see him flog her with a whip. He smiled queerly, as a man would smile after\\n', 'telling some hideous domestic tragedy. \"She has done this ever since I moved in\\n', 'here.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The dog was Strickland's dog, so I said nothing, but I felt all that Strickland\\n\", 'felt in being made light of. Tietjens encamped outside my bedroom window, and\\n', 'storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch, and died away. The\\n', 'lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spattered a barn door, but the\\n', 'light was pale blue, not yellow; and looking through my slit bamboo blinds, I\\n', 'could see the great dog standing, not sleeping, in the veranda, the hackles\\n', 'alift on her back, and her feet planted as tensely as the drawn wire rope of a\\n', 'suspension bridge. In the very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep,\\n', 'but it seemed that some one wanted me very badly. He, whoever he was, was\\n', 'trying to call me by name, but his voice was no more than a husky whisper. Then\\n', 'the thunder ceased and Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low\\n', 'moon. Somebody tried to open my door, and walked about and through the house,\\n', 'and stood breathing heavily in the verandas, and just when I was falling asleep\\n', 'I fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamoring above my head or on the\\n', 'door.\\n', '\\n', \"I ran into Strickland's room and asked him whether he was ill and had been\\n\", 'calling for me. He was lying on the bed half-dressed, with a pipe in his mouth.\\n', '\"I thought you\\'d come,\" he said. \"Have I been walking around the house at all?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I explained that he had been in the dining-room and the smoking-room and two or\\n', 'three other places; and he laughed and told me to go back to bed. I went back\\n', 'to bed and slept till the morning, but in all my dreams I was sure I was doing\\n', 'some one an injustice in not attending to his wants. What those wants were I\\n', 'could not tell, but a fluttering, whispering, bolt-fumbling, luring, loitering\\n', 'some one was reproaching me for my slackness, and through all the dreams I\\n', 'heard the howling of Tietjens in the garden and the thrashing of the rain.\\n', '\\n', 'I was in that house for two days, and Strickland went to his office daily,\\n', 'leaving me alone for eight or ten hours a day, with Tietjens for my only\\n', 'companion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable, and so was\\n', 'Tietjens; but in the twilight she and I moved into the back veranda and cuddled\\n', 'each other for company. We were alone in the house, but for all that it was\\n', 'fully occupied by a tenant with whom I had no desire to interfere. I never saw\\n', 'him, but I could see the curtains between the rooms quivering where he had just\\n', 'passed through; I could hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a\\n', 'weight that had just quitted them; and I could feel when I went to get a book\\n', 'from the dining-room that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front\\n', 'veranda till I should have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more\\n', 'interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms, with every hair erect, and\\n', 'following the motions of something that I could not see. She never entered the\\n', 'rooms, but her eyes moved, and that was quite sufficient. Only when my servant\\n', 'came to trim the lamps and make all light and habitable, she would come in with\\n', 'me and spend her time sitting on her haunches watching an invisible extra man\\n', 'as he moved about behind my shoulder. Dogs are cheerful companions.\\n', '\\n', 'I explained to Strickland, gently as might be, that I would go over to the club\\n', 'and find for myself quarters there. I admired his hospitality, was pleased with\\n', 'his guns and rods, but I did not much care for his house and its atmosphere. He\\n', 'heard me out to the end, and then smiled very wearily, but without contempt,\\n', 'for he is a man who understands things. \"Stay on,\" he said, \"and see what this\\n', 'thing means. All you have talked about I have known since I took the bungalow.\\n', 'Stay on and wait. Tietjens has left me. Are you going too?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I had seen him through one little affair connected with an idol that had\\n', 'brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and I had no desire to help him\\n', 'through further experiences. He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses arrived as\\n', 'do dinners to ordinary people.\\n', '\\n', 'Therefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely, and\\n', \"would he happy to see him in the daytime, but that I didn't care to sleep under\\n\", 'his roof. This was after dinner, when Tietjens had gone out to lie in the\\n', 'veranda.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Pon my soul, I don\\'t wonder,\" said Strickland, with his eyes on the ceiling-\\n', 'cloth. \"Look at that.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The tails of two snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice of the\\n', 'wall. They threw long shadows in the lamp-light. \"If you are afraid of snakes,\\n', 'of course\"--said Strickland. \"I hate and fear snakes, because if you look into\\n', \"the eyes of any snake you will see that it knows all and more of man's fall,\\n\", 'and that it feels all the contempt that the devil felt when Adam was evicted\\n', 'from Eden. Besides which its bite is generally fatal, and it bursts up trouser\\n', 'legs.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You ought to get your thatch over-hauled,\" I said. \"Give me a masheer rod, and\\n', 'we\\'ll poke \\'em down.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ll hide among the roof beams,\" said Strickland. \"I  can\\'t stand snakes\\n', \"overhead. I'm going up. If I shake 'em down, stand by with a cleaning-rod and\\n\", 'break their backs.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work, hut I took the loading-rod\\n', \"and waited in the dining-room, while Strickland brought a gardener's ladder\\n\", 'from the veranda and set it against the side of the room. The snake tails drew\\n', 'themselves up and disappeared. We could hear the dry rushing scuttle of long\\n', 'bodies running over the baggy cloth. Strickland took a lamp with him, while I\\n', 'tried to make clear the danger of hunting roof snakes between a ceiling cloth\\n', 'and a thatch, apart from the deterioration of property caused by ripping out\\n', 'ceiling-cloths.\\n', '\\n', '\"N o n s en s e \" said Strickland. \"They\\'re sure to hide near the walls by the\\n', \"cloth. The bricks are too cold for 'em, and the heat of the room is just what\\n\", 'they like.\" He put his hands to the corner of the cloth and ripped the rotten\\n', 'stuff from the cornice. It gave great sound of tearing, and Strickland put his\\n', 'head through the opening into the dark of the angle of the roof beams. I set my\\n', 'teeth and lifted the loading-rod, for I had not the least knowledge of what\\n', 'might descend.\\n', '\\n', '\"H\\'m,\" said Strickland; and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof. \"There\\'s\\n', 'room for another set of rooms up here, and, by Jove! some one is occupying em.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Snakes?\" I said down below.\\n', '\\n', '\"No. It\\'s a buffalo. Hand me up the two first joints of a masheer rod, and I\\'ll\\n', 'prod it. It\\'s lying on the main beam.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I handed up the rod.\\n', '\\n', '\"What a nest for owls and serpents! No wonder the snakes live here,\" said\\n', 'Strickland, climbing further into the roof. I could see his elbow thrusting\\n', 'with the rod. \"Come out of that, whoever you are! Look out! Heads below there!\\n', 'It\\'s tottering.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I saw the ceiling-cloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a shape that\\n', 'was pressing it downward and downward toward the lighted lamps on the table. I\\n', 'snatched a lamp out of danger and stood back. Then the cloth ripped out from\\n', 'the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot down upon the table something that I\\n', 'dared not look at till Strickland had slid down the ladder and was standing by\\n', 'my side.\\n', '\\n', 'He did not say much, being a man of few words, but he picked up the loose end\\n', 'of the table-cloth and threw it over the thing on the table.\\n', '\\n', '\"It strikes me,\" said he, pulling down the lamp, \"our friend Imray has come\\n', 'back. Oh! you would, would you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'There was a movement under the cloth, and a little snake wriggled out, to be\\n', 'back-broken by the butt of the masheer rod. I was sufficiently sick to make no\\n', 'remarks worth recording.\\n', '\\n', 'Strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks liberally. The thing under\\n', 'the cloth made no more signs of life.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is it Imray?\" I said.\\n', '\\n', 'Strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked. \"It is Imray,\" he\\n', 'said, \"and his throat is cut from ear to ear.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then we spoke both together and to ourselves:\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s why he whispered about the house.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Tietjens, in the garden, began to bay furiously. A little later her great nose\\n', 'heaved upon the dining-room door.\\n', '\\n', 'She sniffed and was still. The broken and tattered ceiling-cloth hung down\\n', 'almost to the level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away from\\n', 'the discovery.\\n', '\\n', 'Then Tietjens came in and sat down, her teeth bared and her forepaws planted.\\n', 'She looked at Strickland.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s bad business, old lady,\" said he. \"Men don\\'t go up into the roofs of\\n', \"their bungalows to die, and they don't fasten up the ceiling-cloth behind 'em.\\n\", 'Let\\'s think it out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let\\'s think it out somewhere else,\" I said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Excellent idea! Turn the lamps out. We\\'ll get into my room.\"\\n', '\\n', \"I did not turn the lamps out. I went into Strickland's room first and allowed\\n\", 'him to make the darkness. Then he followed me, and we lighted tobacco and\\n', 'thought. Strickland did the thinking. I smoked furiously because I was afraid.\\n', '\\n', '\"Imray is back,\" said Strickland. \"The question is, who killed Imray? Don\\'t\\n', 'talk--I have a notion of my own. When I took this bungalow I took most of\\n', 'Imray\\'s servants. Imray was guileless and inoffensive, wasn\\'t he?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I agreed, though the heap under the cloth looked neither one thing nor the\\n', 'other.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I call the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like Aryans.\\n', 'What do you suggest?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Call \\'em in one by one,\" I said.\\n', '\\n', '\"They\\'ll run away and give the news to all their fellows,\" said Strickland.\\n', '\\n', '\"We must segregate \\'em. Do you suppose your servant knows anything about it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He may, for aught I know, hut I don\\'t think it\\'s likely. He has only been here\\n', 'two or three days.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s your notion?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', '\"I can\\'t quite tell. How the dickens did the man get the wrong side of the\\n', 'ceiling-cloth?\"\\n', '\\n', \"There was a heavy coughing outside Strickland's bedroom door. This showed that\\n\", 'Bahadur Khan, his body-servant, had waked from sleep and wished to put\\n', 'Strickland to bed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Come in,\" said Strickland. \"It is a very warm night, isn\\'t it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bahadur Khan, a great, green-turbaned, six-foot Mohammedan, said that it was a\\n', \"very warm night, but that there was more rain pending, which, by his honor's\\n\", 'favor, would bring relief to the country.\\n', '\\n', '\"It will be so, if God pleases,\" said Strickland, tugging off his hoots. \"It is\\n', 'in my mind, Bahadur Khan, that I have worked thee remorselessly for many days--\\n', 'ever since that time when thou first came into my service. What time was that?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Has the heaven-born forgotten? It was when Imray Sahib went secretly to Europe\\n', 'without warning given, and I--even I--came into the honored service of the\\n', 'protector of the poor.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And Imray Sahib went to Europe?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is so said among the servants.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And thou wilt take service with him when he returns?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Assuredly, sahib. He was a good master and cherished his dependents.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is true. I am very tired, but I can go buck-shooting tomorrow. Give me\\n', 'the little rifle that I use for black buck; it is in the case yonder.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man stooped over the case, banded barrels, stock, and fore-end to\\n', 'Strickland, who fitted them together. Yawning dolefully, then he reached down\\n', 'to the gun-case, took a solid drawn cartridge, and slipped it into the breech\\n', 'of the .360 express.\\n', '\\n', '\"And Imray Sahib has gone to Europe secretly? That is very strange, Bahadur\\n', 'Khan, is it not?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What do I know of the ways of the white man, heaven-born?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very little, truly. But thou shalt know more. It has reached me that Imray\\n', 'Sahib has returned from his so long journeyings, and that even now he lies in\\n', 'the next room, waiting his servant.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sahib!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The lamp-light slid along the barrels of the rifle as they leveled themselves\\n', \"against Bahadur Khan's broad breast.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Go, then, and look!\" said Strickland. \"Take a lamp. Thy master is tired, and\\n', 'he waits. Go!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man picked up a lamp and went into the dining-room, Strickland following,\\n', 'and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle. He looked for a moment at\\n', 'the black depths behind the ceiling-cloth, at the carcass of the mangled snake\\n', 'under foot, and last, a grey glaze setting on his face, at the thing under the\\n', 'table-cloth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hast thou seen?\" said Strickland, after a pause.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have seen. I am clay in the white man\\'s hands. What does the presence do?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hang thee within a month! What else?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"For killing him? Nay, sahib, consider. Walking among us, his servants, he cast\\n', 'his eyes upon my child, who was four years old. Him he bewitched, and in ten\\n', 'days he died of the fever.

When he had cut down all the trees and burned\\n', 'the underwood, the stumps still remained. Dynamite is expensive and slow fire\\n', 'slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing is the lord of all beasts, who is the\\n', 'elephant. He will either push the stump out of the ground with his tusks, if he\\n', 'has any, or drag it out with ropes. The planter, therefore, hired elephants by\\n', 'ones and twos and threes, and fell to work. The very best of all the elephants\\n', 'belonged to the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts; and this superior\\n', \"beast's name was Moti Guj. He was the absolute property of his mahout, which\\n\", 'would never have been the case under native rule; for Moti Guj was a creature\\n', 'to be desired by kings, and his name, being translated, meant the Pearl\\n', 'Elephant. Because the British government was in the land, Deesa, the mahout,\\n', 'enjoyed his property undisturbed. He was dissipated. When he had made much\\n', 'money through the strength of his elephant, he would get extremely drunk and\\n', 'give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg over the tender nails of the forefeet.\\n', 'Moti Guj never trampled the life out of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew\\n', 'that after the beating was over, Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and\\n', 'call him his love and his life and the liver of his soul, and give him some\\n', 'liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of liquor--arrack for choice, though he would\\n', 'drink palm-tree toddy if nothing better offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep\\n', \"between Moti Guj's forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of the\\n\", 'public road, and as Moti Guj mounted guard over him, and would not permit\\n', 'horse, foot, or cart to pass by, traffic was congested till Deesa saw fit to\\n', 'wake up.\\n', '\\n', \"There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter's clearing: the wages were\\n\", \"too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj's neck and gave him orders, while Moti\\n\", 'Guj rooted up the stumps--for he owned a magnificent pair of tusks; or pulled\\n', 'at the end of a rope--for he had a magnificent pair of shoulders--while Deesa\\n', 'kicked him behind the ears and said he was the king of elephants. At evening\\n', \"time Moti Guj would wash down his three hundred pounds' weight of green food\\n\", 'with a quart of arrack, and Deesa would take a share, and sing songs between\\n', \"Moti Guj's legs till it was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj\\n\", 'down to the river, and Moti Gui lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows,\\n', 'while Deesa went over him with a coir swab and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook\\n', 'the pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to\\n', 'get up and turn over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his feet and\\n', 'examine his eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores\\n', 'or budding ophthalmia. After inspection the two would come up with a song from\\n', 'the sea, Moti Guj, all black and shining, waving a torn tree branch twelve feet\\n', 'long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his own long wet hair.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the desire to\\n', 'drink deep. He wished for an orgy. The little draughts that led nowhere were\\n', 'taking the manhood out of him.\\n', '\\n', 'He went to the planter, and \"My mother\\'s dead,\" said he, weeping.\\n', '\\n', '\"She died on the last plantation two months ago, and she died once before that\\n', 'when you were working for me last year,\" said the planter, who knew something\\n', 'of the ways of nativedom.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then it\\'s my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to me,\" said Deesa,\\n', 'weeping more than ever. \"She has left eighteen small children entirely without\\n', 'bread, and it is I who must fill their little stomachs,\" said Deesa, beating\\n', 'his head on the floor.\\n', '\\n', '\"Who brought the news?\" said the planter.\\n', '\\n', '\"The post,\" said Deesa.\\n', '\\n', '\"There hasn\\'t been a post here for the past week.

He swung clear, looked round,\\n', 'shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away, as one having business\\n', 'elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hi! ho!

Moti Guj paid the white man the compliment of\\n', 'charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing and \"Hrrumphing\"\\n', 'him into his veranda. Then he stood outside the house, chuckling to himself and\\n', 'shaking all over with the fun of it, as an elephant will.\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'ll thrash him,\" said the planter. \"He shall have the finest thrashing ever\\n', 'elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve foot of chain apiece, and\\n', 'tell them to lay on twenty.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Kala Nag--which means Black Snake--and Nazim were two of the biggest elephants\\n', 'in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer the graver punishment,\\n', 'since no man can beat an elephant properly.\\n', '\\n', 'They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as they sidled\\n', 'up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti Guj had never, in all\\n', 'his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped, and he did not intend to begin a\\n', 'new experience. So he waited, waving his head from right to left, and measuring\\n', \"the precise spot in Kala Nag's fat side where a blunt tusk could sink deepest.\\n\", 'Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain was the badge of his authority; but for all\\n', 'that, he swung wide of Moti Guj at the last minute, and tried to appear as if\\n', 'he had brought the chain out for amusement. Nazim turned round and went home\\n', 'early. He did not feel fighting fit that morning, and so Moti Guj was left\\n', 'standing alone with his ears cocked.\\n', '\\n', 'That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back to his\\n', 'amateur inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work and is not\\n', 'tied up is about as manageable as an eighty-one-ton gun loose in a heavy\\n', 'seaway. He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps were\\n', 'coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning labor and the inalienable\\n', \"rights of elephants to a long 'nooning'; and, wandering to and fro, he\\n\", 'thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown, when he returned to his picket\\n', 'for food.\\n', '\\n', '\"If you won\\'t work, you sha\\'n\\'t eat,\" said Chihun, angrily. \"You\\'re a wild\\n', 'elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your jungle.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Chihun's little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut, and stretching\\n\", 'out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj knew well that it\\n', 'was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out his trunk with a\\n', 'fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw itself, shouting, upon\\n', 'it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in the air\\n', \"twelve feet above his father's head.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Great Lord!\" said Chihun. \"Flour cakes of the best, twelve in number, two feet\\n', 'across and soaked in rum, shall be yours on the instant, and two hundred pounds\\n', 'weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane therewith. Deign only to put down safely\\n', 'that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to me!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet, that could\\n', \"have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun's hut, and waited for his food. He ate\\n\", 'it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed and thought of Deesa. One\\n', 'of many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge body needs less\\n', 'sleep than anything else that lives. Four or five hours in the night suffice--\\n', \"two just before midnight, lying down on one side; two just after one o'clock,\\n\", 'lying down on the other. The rest of the silent hours are filled with eating\\n', 'and fidgeting, and long grumbling soliloquies.\\n', '\\n', 'At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a thought had\\n', 'come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark forest with\\n', 'none to look after him. So all that night he chased through the undergrowth,\\n', 'blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears. He went down to the river and\\n', 'blared across the shallows where Deesa used to wash him, hut there was no\\n', 'answer. He could not find Deesa, but he disturbed all the other elephants in\\n', 'the lines, and nearly frightened to death some gypsies in the woods.\\n', '\\n', 'At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk in deed, and\\n', 'he expected to get into trouble for outstaying his leave. He drew a long breath\\n', 'when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still uninjured, for he\\n', \"knew something of Moti Guj's temper, and reported himself with many lies and\\n\", 'salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for breakfast. The night exercise had\\n', 'made him hungry.\\n', '\\n', '\"Call up your beast,\" said the planter; and Deesa shouted in the mysterious\\n', 'elephant language that some mahouts believe came from China at the birth of the\\n', 'world, when elephants and not men were masters. Moti Guj heard and came.\\n', 'Elephants do not gallop They move from places at varying rates of speed. If an\\n', 'elephant wished to catch an express train he could not gallop, but he could\\n', \"catch the train. So Moti Guj was at the planter's door almost before Chihun\\n\", \"noticed that he had left his pickets. He fell into Deesa's arms trumpeting with\\n\", 'joy, and the man and beast wept and slobbered over each other, and handled each\\n', 'other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen\\n', '\\n', '\"Now we will get to work,\" said Deesa. \"Lift me up, my son and my joy!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Moti Guj swung him up, and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look for\\n', 'difficult stumps.\\n', '\\n', 'The planter was too astonished to be very angry.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'End of The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Works of Rudyard Kipling\\n', '\\n']\n"
